it is worth mentioning that all lectures are relevant for example recently most of classes are involved in how to perform in a presentation,0.25,0.32238784
i think the difficult one to achieve is present and review theory evidence and interpretation honestly accurately objectively and without bias which from the raes statement of ethical principles,0.75,0.38817888
because i learned many theories in my university i am not sure which situation is belongs to which theory,0.5,0.5403132
the main difference is that everyone in the group has strong characteristics nearly everyone has so many great strengths and good leadership,0.5,0.5414329

teachers would interact with the classmates,0.0,0.24324387
they are kindly to help us and tech us how to be better than before,0.25,0.29700106

its not too much which might waste some time and make students fell nervous,0.5,0.34642333
of course i admit that these inductions give me plenty of help in study life as well as i really need some time to fit into british life,0.75,0.52510655

the teacher will ask open questions to arouse students thinking,0.0,0.2551065
the most helpful aspect is how to corporate with group members and how to be a leader to support the development of the group,0.75,0.42698538
and this kind of evaluation system is very valuable for us to know where we should improve,0.25,0.5133308
after receiving cooperative learning tasks team members do not talk or discuss with each other they work alone and do not really participate in the cooperationthis phenomenon often results in unsuccessful cooperationor we dont have enough time to prepare,0.5,0.4848892
the lecture flew logically generally but it would be better if the lectuere can review the content of last class at the startsome of the lecturers are humourous such as bidyut and international businese lecturer sorry i do not his nameall lecturers are good in the respect of helping me move from one point to the next,0.75,0.50611436

actually i am worried that i can not integrate into the school life better and faster,0.75,0.6270166
first communication is vital to the process of the group work,0.75,0.22557223
there are so many things i can learn from observing their delivery such as how to get eyecontact with your audiences how to interact with them,0.75,0.49732184
