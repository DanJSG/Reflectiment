although most chinese students are not willing to take the initiative to answer the teachers questions they still take notes and listen carefully
these learning processes are something i have not experienced before
a common technique used by lecturers is：1excellent opening remarks：the opening should attract students attention build trust with students create a positive atmosphere and establish a positive image of the lecturer2a valid conclusion：summarize the main points at the end
but most of the time we take it seriouslyto my surprise although most of the class are chinese students like me we are very willing to communicate with classmates from other countries and get along well with each other
if every member wants to get a distinguished degree they can devote themselves to it wholeheartedly
but there are still many personal problems that need to be addressed1
in the market technology department the teacher has taught us a lot of methods of market analysis
i need to pay more tension in my homework than before
i am expected about the final project but i am not sure i can do well with it because this project needs everyone in my group to make effort together
now the feedbacks of lectures are very important and useful which can help me to understand the theories but i received the feedback rarely before7
he used the simple wordsand told me do not use any difficult words
i was one of the rebellious teenagers and i started to studyindependently in a city far from my parents when i entered universitytherefore i have enough grades to apply for this university fortunatelyin real life we always haveto spend a lot of time to communicate in the weekends and prove our gregarioushowever too long communication activities have compressed our own learningtime
negative behavior occurs for avariety of personal reasons
my study plan is also not very different from the schools overview
break down a difficult task into several parts to save time and then you can assign different roles
theynever apply reductions in the marks for late deliveries3 commitment i feel that there is a lower sensation ofcommitment with the msc here in york from my classmates than my undergraduatescolleagues in my bachelors4 classrooms i have had some classes in theaterstyleclassrooms
thirdly sometimesi could not manage my time well it is really hard to achieve the worklifebalancefor example i need to go to the gym but i also need to do my homework i couldnot separate the time to both of them and finally i only can finish one thingthat would makes me lowproductive and makes me feel bad
the site you give us should be an english language siteinsert your link below
for example there was a problem with the computer
i learned how to use mind mapping and key points to take notes from 4weeks presessional programme
language barrier
first i gained unity awareness because we need to discuss and achieve every task together
as a student i also aspire to be a distinction grade student
i prefer the way to marking our assignments in uk very muchfifthly almost all the students in china can pass the exam and graduate
1 clear outline2
therefore we can get a better result
it means that the lecturers and the msc directors are working to improve the msc content
so after class i need spent more time to review the content and understand the content what the lecturers said during the classes
i really need to take notes because i use to quickly forget things that i dont practice a lot
the structure of each lecture is really nice
this is the most different thing
for instance we recordedour promotional video about our business idea
and with my classmates who are from a different background including different age working experience nation and family
of course it surprised me
can cook well now8
firstly i often have one item on the list that is hanging over my head and just doesn  t seem like it will get taken care of
i can always provide creative ideas and help when they need5
i expected more interaction at masters level compared to bachelors
they were all unforgettable even though there were two man absent in the session and we met eacn other at the supervisor session
in terms of learning methods it is necessary to profoundly understand the goals and intentions of the course content setting of each course grasp the key points of the teachers class content and strictly exclude all external factors in the learning attitude and concentrate on the energy in a certain period of time
sometimes i dont understand my notes very well when i read them because i may not remember the example that the teacher said at that time
all of this can help me have a better life in the next year
yes the teaching style is my ideal style
tutors do not give you some simple contents rather than some model or strategies that you will need during homework so it is critical for our reports7
in china many teachers are boring and rigid in their lectures
i also read lots of documents and reports although it is tutor asked us to read
for example some people want to adopt a strategy but other people want to adopt another strategy
only in this way can improve the efficiency in teamwork
i heart from my classmates that some students are selfish and arrogant and refuse to cooperate with others these behaviors will hinder success
jin is a chinese student who worked for 5 years before come here
as i have to listen to many lectures given by teachers every weekday i found teachers use the presentation skills into the lectures skillfully
absolutely yes but for mea chinese student the big problem is we used the totally different language before my only concern about the report and essay things like that i need to write in english im afraid of the grammar and so on
i started my masters and start taking notes on diary then i realized that is not enough because in the uk masters system has report writing and assessments for which i need skills of ms word and i need to strong grip on ms word so i start making notes on ms word and start highlighting with red color so i keep in mind those points while reading slides and lectures and now because of this step in am progressing positively in making my assessment my methods and way of taking notes and organizingnote down things that the instructor says more than oncebe selective don  t take down every single note take down the main points of the lecture or discussionhandwritten notes work best for classes that have to do withon your computer make sure that you have one folder for your notes from each different classkeep all the lecture and slides of that subject in that folder of subjectkeep all the syllabic and handouts for each class in the same place as your notes so that they are easily accessiblebe consistent
my supervision group is greateveryone has different skills which can help us successand i think communication is essential for success
from my point of view the most surprised and helpful part is the supervision group
actually it is a small behaviour due to different reasons but i believe that late is unreasonable and not respect tutors and other students
the teaching and learning styles are very different with my previous studying
i am organizing my notes to show levels of significance by marking the significant information according to its significance
itfeels good to be back to school after five years of working but it also feelsquite weird at the same time
authoritarian could kill the creativity
learning strategieshow to reasonably arrange your study time and entertainment time is a big challenge4
the first thing is although i have studiedfor my premaster degree last year i can not stand some english habit whichmeans i can not complete get involved into uk culture
i like the comfortable and relaxed atmosphere of induction
the most important thing is to help me understand my classmates and make new friends
however this small aspect generally does not enter the entire group of seminars
it takes a lot of time for traveling
once we needed to perform a short drama in class i was surprised to find that their performances were both excellent and they did bring me lots of fun
international business is a novelty course for me
now the varieties of homework are different which make the study interesting but i did the same type of homework in most courses before6
as amatter of fact students who get up at different times will have differentlearning time
compared with guest lecturers from outside the uni lectures were easy to understand in terms of the language for my standard
weijia huang is creative and active
first of all you must have a good understanding of everyone on the team because this is the basis for cooperation with them
i only read something in the textbook before4
i think the attitude and honesty are the most important factor of successful collaborative learning
the lecturers care about students feeling and often ask students sitting behind to confirm if they can hear clearly or not
therefore i not only expect to graduate successfully but also expect to get higher scores
from a lecture to lecture basis the lectures have followed a sensible order where each lecture build on knowledge learned in the previous lectures
however i found that the teaching style is totally different in uk
this does not necessarily mean that each person should complete the same amount of work or same amount of ours
i hope that we can have some challenges in the future group work
law for engineering management is new for me as a course
however in this level i learned that we will have more group activities
people needs to learn to adhere thatpeople can have a better achieve in goals and have better life what we want
tons of background knowledge i haveobserved and learned during the course
teamwork need to convince everyone to target the common dedication
the whole day was thus disrupted
i believein myself that i can do it
in future modules try to use teamwork as much as possible
i should spend a lot of time every day on homework research the expansion of additional knowledge and language skills improvement
if it is not a major principle problem i think it may be good to listen to others
however every time when i finished the dinner i just want to lie on my bed and play mobile phones or watch youtube videos instead of walking to my desk sit down and start learning
i always finish my notes and then put it aside
so far i am dealingwell with the work given by the different modules
i anticipate we may encounter some problems when we undertake proper group work in the future however as personalities can clash and relying on other people to get things done can sometimes be quite daunting
each one expressed their point of view
for example our supervisor will give us instructive suggestion about our programme works and career in the future the language central is open to public and this will facilitate our international students
his lecture starts with general topicand objectives
in my last degree i just had many practice to do but in york i have to write essays9
my notes helped me to pin point my problems and videos helped me to solve my confusion
at present i think my group members are very thoughtful and have strong executive ability
in order to be more likely to succeed it is also important to ensure that more attention is given to subjects that are found difficult rather than spending all of ones time on those that one finds the easiest as this will mean that one will obtain a more wellrounded knowledge with which to complete assignments
it is worth mentioning that all lectures are relevant for example recently most of classes are involved in how to perform in a presentation
i think the difficult one to achieve is present and review theory evidence and interpretation honestly accurately objectively and without bias which from the raes statement of ethical principles
because i learned many theories in my university i am not sure which situation is belongs to which theory
the main difference is that everyone in the group has strong characteristics nearly everyone has so many great strengths and good leadership
the reasons are complicated but i think one of the primary causes might be the structure and method of teaching completely different from the previous degree that ive done already
sometimes i need to search somewords in dictionary and find out the meaning of words
its easy for me to getcaught up in the trouble of not having to start for example driving acomputer staring at a problem and still have no answer for half an hour
the most helpful is the handbook i can know about what my majors assessment is and i also can know the teaching structure of the engineering management
as to the learning style i think it is more selflearning things than learning things from the lectures
the attributes of these courses mean that we need to read more articles
then i will usein my job when i am going to face with similar problems
for example the thinker oftenindependent thinking has the ability to brainstorm a leader has the abilityto lead a team to victory
however i also found some students would be distracted because of smartphone or something like that
i will pull out all stops
how do you stay focused
every lecture makes it easy for me to understand and the instructor will connect each point in a humorous way to make it easier for me to accept
another way is to let them understand the responsibilityon their shoulder and how bad it is to fail their teammates
during my taught msc i should make sure to keep the knowledge and skills up to date
i think confidence is the most important element to have when a presentation is given
duringtwo months i am more close to the group members because of the group work
if some members have problems they can ask other member for help
in the future study i promise that i will never do anything contrary to the rae ethical principles
theyre not nerds
there are many things to do
i remember in my childhood there was a huge bridge in my hometown established by many engineering managers and workers but the materials and structure of the bridge didnt come up with national standards
in studying my teammates are good at different things like a person is good at accounting which i can learn
so that i think there will be a competition or discussion when we need to choose a group leader
teachers would interact with the classmates
they are kindly to help us and tech us how to be better than before
now i have the confident that i can finish my report assignments with good writing skillsfourthly every question in the exam has the standard answer and seldom can we get the full mark unless our answer is the same as the standard answer
its not too much which might waste some time and make students fell nervous
of course i admit that these inductions give me plenty of help in study life as well as i really need some time to fit into british life
besides i do think the critical thinking is really important our student should be critical to the konwledge we have learnt and always do the independent thinking and studying
knowledge points correspond to background questions
but when i was trying to do some review simple keywords are not so efficient to revive my memories
basicallybecause his objectives sometimes are not clear when he starts his lecturehowever his lectures are not boring because he uses a lot of his skill ofhumor and he teaches us with examples
i was very lucky to be one of the twothe seminar began at 9 amso we booked the flight at 7 ambefore the daybut i was so excited that i slept little that nightand the next morning i woke up late at around 6 oclockit needed 40 minute from my home to airportso i felt very nervousand run out from my home in a hurry
i think it should be the characters of my teammates some of which are so positive and enthusiastic and it makes me feel more confident about our projects in the future
the teacher will ask open questions to arouse students thinking
the most helpful aspect is how to corporate with group members and how to be a leader to support the development of the group
and this kind of evaluation system is very valuable for us to know where we should improve
after receiving cooperative learning tasks team members do not talk or discuss with each other they work alone and do not really participate in the cooperationthis phenomenon often results in unsuccessful cooperationor we dont have enough time to prepare
the lecture flew logically generally but it would be better if the lectuere can review the content of last class at the startsome of the lecturers are humourous such as bidyut and international businese lecturer sorry i do not his nameall lecturers are good in the respect of helping me move from one point to the next
ithink that in this case people need to learn from other culture
there were some discussions and a lot of interactions between speakers and audience
first it should be my parents  support and trust
i think im very lucky with the team i got we are all from different countries from peru china and spain and i think that its going to help and teach us a lot from different cultures
i think their proper eye contact is one of the most valuable things i can learn from them
in the past usually four or more people share one room
i wonder if my skill is not strong enough to support me to take intact note but i gradually realized that some of my friends also couldnt do this thing very well
actually i am worried that i can not integrate into the school life better and faster
first communication is vital to the process of the group work
there are so many things i can learn from observing their delivery such as how to get eyecontact with your audiences how to interact with them
therefore there will be insufficient library space at the end of the period
i think the unity is the most essential factors to success in collaborative learning
i just talked about three part of this topic
