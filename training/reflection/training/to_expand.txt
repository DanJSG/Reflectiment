maybe in the future i should try harder to change my mind and learn more about the advanced knowledgesince i have recognised some of my problems i should overcome my shortcomings and make more efforts to get the distinction
of course it surprised me
the content of my first degree study is electrical engineering and automation
i learned how to use mind mapping and key points to take notes from 4weeks presessional programme
compared with guest lecturers from outside the uni lectures were easy to understand in terms of the language for my standard
as a student i also aspire to be a distinction grade student
teaching facilities after years of development of science and technology the evaluation standard of teaching facilities has been divided into two parts software and hardware
in china many teachers are boring and rigid in their lectures
the first thing is although i have studiedfor my premaster degree last year i can not stand some english habit whichmeans i can not complete get involved into uk culture
now the varieties of homework are different which make the study interesting but i did the same type of homework in most courses before6
however this small aspect generally does not enter the entire group of seminars
i expect that i can improve my critical thinking and spoken english
the lectures are so interactive and hence we could get a better idea about the topics discussed during the class
if it is not a major principle problem i think it may be good to listen to others
authoritarian could kill the creativity
the most helpful is the handbook i can know about what my majors assessment is and i also can know the teaching structure of the engineering management
actually it is a small behaviour due to different reasons but i believe that late is unreasonable and not respect tutors and other students
sometimes i need to search somewords in dictionary and find out the meaning of words
however some time i find i just copy the ppt and i paid too much attention on writing without hearing what teachers said
weijia huang is creative and active
i also read lots of documents and reports although it is tutor asked us to read
i need to pay more tension in my homework than before
my supervision group is greateveryone has different skills which can help us successand i think communication is essential for success
i think i can but there are some challenges may be faced by myself for example even though i will study knowledge and skill as much as possible but it is difficult to keep up the latest matter in time during my taught msc or working life however i will try my best to update professional skills timely
tons of background knowledge i haveobserved and learned during the course
i started my masters and start taking notes on diary then i realized that is not enough because in the uk masters system has report writing and assessments for which i need skills of ms word and i need to strong grip on ms word so i start making notes on ms word and start highlighting with red color so i keep in mind those points while reading slides and lectures and now because of this step in am progressing positively in making my assessment my methods and way of taking notes and organizingnote down things that the instructor says more than oncebe selective don  t take down every single note take down the main points of the lecture or discussionhandwritten notes work best for classes that have to do withon your computer make sure that you have one folder for your notes from each different classkeep all the lecture and slides of that subject in that folder of subjectkeep all the syllabic and handouts for each class in the same place as your notes so that they are easily accessiblebe consistent
those different styles are not only attractive but also develop my abilities like critical analysis logical thinking and establishing structure6
the studying and living environments are very different to formerfor studying environment first of all the studying style is not same
i just talked about three part of this topic
my study plan is also not very different from the schools overview
firstly i often have one item on the list that is hanging over my head and just doesn  t seem like it will get taken care of
cooperating with others enables me to learn a lot such as team awareness or learning strengths from others may be a careful and meticulous habit may be the unique thinking perspectives may be the spirit of persistence which i could not learn from independent study
second a coordinator who can lead the meeting and whois going to establish the rules
the lecture flew logically generally but it would be better if the lectuere can review the content of last class at the startsome of the lecturers are humourous such as bidyut and international businese lecturer sorry i do not his nameall lecturers are good in the respect of helping me move from one point to the next
only after that i will do other things such as preparing for tomorrows class and reading the recommended books
the teacher  s interaction with us is short but they can pass on the most important information to us
then a large number of notes will appear relatively confusing which makes it impossible for me to see the meaning and logical structure that the lecturers want to express
the teaching and learning styles are very different with my previous studying
each of us played very importantrole in order that the video will be recorded with success
and relying on these questions i can understand the knowledge deeply
teachers would interact with the classmates
now the feedbacks of lectures are very important and useful which can help me to understand the theories but i received the feedback rarely before7
such as they are smart they have a strong ability to remember andthey can solve problems in a new and creative way such as they can using somelearning tools to assist their learning
actually i am worried that i can not integrate into the school life better and faster
in fact i have now been in york studying for four months and i adapt to study and life well
in studying my teammates are good at different things like a person is good at accounting which i can learn
first this is different with my mahor when i was an undergraduate
the most helpful aspect is how to corporate with group members and how to be a leader to support the development of the group
i can always provide creative ideas and help when they need5
now i have the confident that i can finish my report assignments with good writing skillsfourthly every question in the exam has the standard answer and seldom can we get the full mark unless our answer is the same as the standard answer
first communication is vital to the process of the group work
i should spend a lot of time every day on homework research the expansion of additional knowledge and language skills improvement
but there are still many personal problems that need to be addressed1
how do you stay focused
i hope that we can have some challenges in the future group work
i was very lucky to be one of the twothe seminar began at 9 amso we booked the flight at 7 ambefore the daybut i was so excited that i slept little that nightand the next morning i woke up late at around 6 oclockit needed 40 minute from my home to airportso i felt very nervousand run out from my home in a hurry
the first thing i gained from collaborative learning is communicationfrom my work in groups i knew that i need to learn to communicate with group memebers and understand thembecause there are different personalities in a group especially when there are memebers from different countires in a groupthis will create cultural differences so we need to communicate with each other and avoid conflicts that cultural differences bringthe second thing i gained from collaborative learning is toleranceif we have the attitude of tolerance when we do collaborative learning we can accept ideas and opinions from othersthis can make us learn somethin new really from others
in future modules try to use teamwork as much as possible
for example the thinker oftenindependent thinking has the ability to brainstorm a leader has the abilityto lead a team to victory
i think confidence is the most important element to have when a presentation is given
the lecturers care about students feeling and often ask students sitting behind to confirm if they can hear clearly or not
theyre not nerds
however i know that our time is limited i need to usecollaborative learning in order to grasp the theory very well
this idea surprised me and we did successfully ultimately
firstly i should learn about thecourse information
this does not necessarily mean that each person should complete the same amount of work or same amount of ours
its not always that situation but in cases where the teachers ask something in the class and anybody can answer to the question and me even after knowing the answer i tend to keep quiet
after receiving cooperative learning tasks team members do not talk or discuss with each other they work alone and do not really participate in the cooperationthis phenomenon often results in unsuccessful cooperationor we dont have enough time to prepare
as to the learning style i think it is more selflearning things than learning things from the lectures
theynever apply reductions in the marks for late deliveries3 commitment i feel that there is a lower sensation ofcommitment with the msc here in york from my classmates than my undergraduatescolleagues in my bachelors4 classrooms i have had some classes in theaterstyleclassrooms
1 clear outline2
i think im very lucky with the team i got we are all from different countries from peru china and spain and i think that its going to help and teach us a lot from different cultures
every lecture makes it easy for me to understand and the instructor will connect each point in a humorous way to make it easier for me to accept
the worst case scenario is that i sometimes skipped the classes and went to play video game
i think my groupmates are nice
the main differences are that we all come from different perspectives of working and different point of view due to we most of us come from different countriescultures but i think this will teach us a lot and we will learn how to work with different type of people
in my last degree i just had many practice to do but in york i have to write essays9
first i realized that the group members need to communicate
i will pull out all stops
the reasons are complicated but i think one of the primary causes might be the structure and method of teaching completely different from the previous degree that ive done already
only in this way can improve the efficiency in teamwork
it is a goodway to improve my english
i liked the way how the lecture is being presented with claritycontent design and simplicitythe way they get connected while making the presentation making the class lively interactive and engagingand the body language
i only read something in the textbook before4
in english classes there are often guests to give lectures or introduce knowledge
from a lecture to lecture basis the lectures have followed a sensible order where each lecture build on knowledge learned in the previous lectures
each one expressed their point of view
interacting with so many international students during my first term here was really fun
i was one of the rebellious teenagers and i started to studyindependently in a city far from my parents when i entered universitytherefore i have enough grades to apply for this university fortunatelyin real life we always haveto spend a lot of time to communicate in the weekends and prove our gregarioushowever too long communication activities have compressed our own learningtime
from my point of view the most surprised and helpful part is the supervision group
i mean this lecture are lack of some clear slides
i can understand the knowledge of each lesson and review it after class to absorb what i have learnedat the same time the content set in each lesson is connected there will not be many jumps
i think this method is really effective
learning spanish is very funny because the pronounce is comfortable and melodious
ithink that in this case people need to learn from other culture
the whole day was thus disrupted
i really need to take notes because i use to quickly forget things that i dont practice a lot
in the past usually four or more people share one room
in the lecture we usually ask some questions about it
i expected more interaction at masters level compared to bachelors
every day i should have a clear time plan and strictly follow the study plan
as i have to listen to many lectures given by teachers every weekday i found teachers use the presentation skills into the lectures skillfully
therefore i not only expect to graduate successfully but also expect to get higher scores
i try to make it shorter by writing the key words
the content of our lecture refers to many aspects
as for a feedback i want to see if that possible to give an overview of technology in the professionals area with a wide range such as ai and intelligent manufacturing in global prospect it will give us a clearly demand in our future research
why we study is for me get great power to support me to do more valuable things
as the festival was approaching i chatted late with my friends about the festivals the night before so it was two hours later than the scheduled wakeup time
and also i have never got the habit of doing things in prior i always plan it in a way so that i can submit the reports before the deadline
although in the past it violated statement but now know that thesituation in the premise i will be more careful about personal privacy andrespect for the work of partnersin the future development of theindividual i will strictly demand myself with the ethical statement as acriterion to prevent the above situation from happening again
so after class i need spent more time to review the content and understand the content what the lecturers said during the classes
in the future study i promise that i will never do anything contrary to the rae ethical principles
duringtwo months i am more close to the group members because of the group work
i believein myself that i can do it
of coursei believe that i can perform well in the aspects of these principles as an engineering manager
the attributes of these courses mean that we need to read more articles
however every time when i finished the dinner i just want to lie on my bed and play mobile phones or watch youtube videos instead of walking to my desk sit down and start learning
preview is important here
i learn how to take buses recognize roads remember landmarks and so on
a common technique used by lecturers is：1excellent opening remarks：the opening should attract students attention build trust with students create a positive atmosphere and establish a positive image of the lecturer2a valid conclusion：summarize the main points at the end
this is the most different thing
as amatter of fact students who get up at different times will have differentlearning time
professor joanna used mexican wave
students only need to spend money to buy a lot of homework and to ensure high scores no need to spend time to write homework
the teacher will ask open questions to arouse students thinking
learning strategieshow to reasonably arrange your study time and entertainment time is a big challenge4
the structure of each lecture is really nice
in terms of learning methods it is necessary to profoundly understand the goals and intentions of the course content setting of each course grasp the key points of the teachers class content and strictly exclude all external factors in the learning attitude and concentrate on the energy in a certain period of time
there are many things to do
absolutely yes but for mea chinese student the big problem is we used the totally different language before my only concern about the report and essay things like that i need to write in english im afraid of the grammar and so on
the lecturer who teaches us strategic management always give us lively and interesting class
these learning processes are something i have not experienced before
personally i think the biggest difficult to me is if i use my laptop to make notes then i have to improve my typing speed because it is very important
first of all you must have a good understanding of everyone on the team because this is the basis for cooperation with them
for example our supervisor will give us instructive suggestion about our programme works and career in the future the language central is open to public and this will facilitate our international students
the lecture which showed the way to write is very useful
people needs to learn to adhere thatpeople can have a better achieve in goals and have better life what we want
if the time is not enough the teacher will help you answer the questions after class until you really understand
during i get along with mu supervision groupi find that all my group members are very outstandingand some of them have lots of working experiencesi think i can acquire many knowledge when i work with my groupas we just work together for two timesthey might have some strengths and weakness i havent find nowbut we have lots of chance to work together that we can learn more from each other which can help us to become better than before and help us to achieve our goals togetherin the collaborative learningi think a good communication is very important to let the other know your ideabesides thatlearn how to compromise also play an important part in the teamworkit can make the collaboration more efficient
although em belongs to the electronics institute it is quite different from the my universitys engineering major
it is worth mentioning that all lectures are relevant for example recently most of classes are involved in how to perform in a presentation
they are kindly to help us and tech us how to be better than before
for instance we recordedour promotional video about our business idea
besides i do think the critical thinking is really important our student should be critical to the konwledge we have learnt and always do the independent thinking and studying
teamwork need to convince everyone to target the common dedication
basicallybecause his objectives sometimes are not clear when he starts his lecturehowever his lectures are not boring because he uses a lot of his skill ofhumor and he teaches us with examples
because chinese education is centered on the management of teachers which makes us lose a lot of opportunities for practice and exploration so i hope that british schools can give us more time for selflearning so that we can fully explore the limits of the brain and exercise our own thinking ability
break down a difficult task into several parts to save time and then you can assign different roles
i will also go to the library to borrow some books related to the profession to expand my knowledge
so far i am dealingwell with the work given by the different modules
i want to try to coordinate the member relations when there are argument about the assignment
because i learned many theories in my university i am not sure which situation is belongs to which theory
there are so many things i can learn from observing their delivery such as how to get eyecontact with your audiences how to interact with them
it takes a lot of time for traveling
in order to let thestudents review at home i felt that i had enough knowledge that i could getgood grades
international business is a novelty course for me
of course i admit that these inductions give me plenty of help in study life as well as i really need some time to fit into british life
but as a student i think the hardest part is to maintain accuracy and not mislead others
during my taught msc i should make sure to keep the knowledge and skills up to date
my notes helped me to pin point my problems and videos helped me to solve my confusion
and this kind of evaluation system is very valuable for us to know where we should improve
if some members have problems they can ask other member for help
first language issue
we should share our knowledge experienceand opinion with each other and promote the efficiency of group working
its not too much which might waste some time and make students fell nervous
although most chinese students are not willing to take the initiative to answer the teachers questions they still take notes and listen carefully
half contents are in the slides
yesbecause i can learn both technical skill and generic skill
the main difference is that everyone in the group has strong characteristics nearly everyone has so many great strengths and good leadership
in order to be more likely to succeed it is also important to ensure that more attention is given to subjects that are found difficult rather than spending all of ones time on those that one finds the easiest as this will mean that one will obtain a more wellrounded knowledge with which to complete assignments
so that i think there will be a competition or discussion when we need to choose a group leader
but when i was trying to do some review simple keywords are not so efficient to revive my memories
i still remember in junior high school on thewinter vacation there were lots of homework
however i found that the teaching style is totally different in uk
i heart from my classmates that some students are selfish and arrogant and refuse to cooperate with others these behaviors will hinder success
to talk about coping with the academic work as of now i have been just following the lectures and notes then and there and also solving some example sheets for some of my modules
we have been asked to play a short drama or take a video to record our experiment
knowledge points correspond to background questions
i think their proper eye contact is one of the most valuable things i can learn from them
its easy for me to getcaught up in the trouble of not having to start for example driving acomputer staring at a problem and still have no answer for half an hour
because everyone may have different opinions when dealing with different problems it is also important to learn to persuade others
negative behavior occurs for avariety of personal reasons
first i gained unity awareness because we need to discuss and achieve every task together
and with my classmates who are from a different background including different age working experience nation and family
however in this level i learned that we will have more group activities
i wonder if my skill is not strong enough to support me to take intact note but i gradually realized that some of my friends also couldnt do this thing very well
then i will usein my job when i am going to face with similar problems
leadership is a very important skill in group work so if i want to become a leader i must improve my english as soon as possible
it can be unsuccessful if the members of the group are unwilling to take an equal share fo the workload
there were some discussions and a lot of interactions between speakers and audience
therefore there will be insufficient library space at the end of the period
they were all unforgettable even though there were two man absent in the session and we met eacn other at the supervisor session
i have observed this from a very young age of mine that when i am needed to speak something i mostly tend to remain silent
itfeels good to be back to school after five years of working but it also feelsquite weird at the same time
sometimes i dont understand my notes very well when i read them because i may not remember the example that the teacher said at that time
therefore we can get a better result
i am organizing my notes to show levels of significance by marking the significant information according to its significance
therefore we must learn to refuse and do something that is important to you
yes the teaching style is my ideal style
the most important thing is to help me understand my classmates and make new friends
