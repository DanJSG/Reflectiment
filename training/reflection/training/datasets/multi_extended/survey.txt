i started my masters and start taking notes on diary then i realized that is not enough because in the uk masters system has report writing and assessments for which i need skills of ms word and i need to strong grip on ms word so i start making notes on ms word and start highlighting with red color so i keep in mind those points while reading slides and lectures and now because of this step in am progressing positively in making my assessment my methods and way of taking notes and organizingnote down things that the instructor says more than oncebe selective don  t take down every single note take down the main points of the lecture or discussionhandwritten notes work best for classes that have to do withon your computer make sure that you have one folder for your notes from each different classkeep all the lecture and slides of that subject in that folder of subjectkeep all the syllabic and handouts for each class in the same place as your notes so that they are easily accessiblebe consistent:1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
