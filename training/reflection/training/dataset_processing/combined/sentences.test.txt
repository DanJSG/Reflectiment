break down a difficult task into several parts to save time and then you can assign different roles
i have observed this from a very young age of mine that when i am needed to speak something i mostly tend to remain silent
the attributes of these courses mean that we need to read more articles
however some time i find i just copy the ppt and i paid too much attention on writing without hearing what teachers said
so we should do the work as soon as possible and then go to other activities not only to improve the quality of learning but also to avoid missing the deadline
as i have to listen to many lectures given by teachers every weekday i found teachers use the presentation skills into the lectures skillfully
this is the most different thing
second a coordinator who can lead the meeting and whois going to establish the rules
i will also go to the library to borrow some books related to the profession to expand my knowledge
now the varieties of homework are different which make the study interesting but i did the same type of homework in most courses before6
i like the comfortable and relaxed atmosphere of induction
i will pull out all stops
the content of my first degree study is electrical engineering and automation
during i get along with mu supervision groupi find that all my group members are very outstandingand some of them have lots of working experiencesi think i can acquire many knowledge when i work with my groupas we just work together for two timesthey might have some strengths and weakness i havent find nowbut we have lots of chance to work together that we can learn more from each other which can help us to become better than before and help us to achieve our goals togetherin the collaborative learningi think a good communication is very important to let the other know your ideabesides thatlearn how to compromise also play an important part in the teamworkit can make the collaboration more efficient
when i back to the dorm afterthe party it was very late
however i know that our time is limited i need to usecollaborative learning in order to grasp the theory very well
preview is important here
in terms of learning methods it is necessary to profoundly understand the goals and intentions of the course content setting of each course grasp the key points of the teachers class content and strictly exclude all external factors in the learning attitude and concentrate on the energy in a certain period of time
when i start to process my undergraduate i was barely taking notes
these learning processes are something i have not experienced before
itfeels good to be back to school after five years of working but it also feelsquite weird at the same time
i still remember in junior high school on thewinter vacation there were lots of homework
i am organizing my notes to show levels of significance by marking the significant information according to its significance
i hope i can learn more management in my mind em include whole information we should learn more skills and i think i will become a whole person by em because i will improve time management skill term work skill talking skill etc
the teacher will ask open questions to arouse students thinking
why we study is for me get great power to support me to do more valuable things
i anticipate we may encounter some problems when we undertake proper group work in the future however as personalities can clash and relying on other people to get things done can sometimes be quite daunting
if some members have problems they can ask other member for help
i also read lots of documents and reports although it is tutor asked us to read
and relying on these questions i can understand the knowledge deeply
of coursei believe that i can perform well in the aspects of these principles as an engineering manager
and also i have never got the habit of doing things in prior i always plan it in a way so that i can submit the reports before the deadline
for example some people want to adopt a strategy but other people want to adopt another strategy
but for me maybe ill choose to turn off the alarm clock and go back to sleep until 10 or even 11 which will cost me a whole morning to do something meaningful
i mean this lecture are lack of some clear slides
i learn how to take buses recognize roads remember landmarks and so on
in fact i have now been in york studying for four months and i adapt to study and life well
teachers would interact with the classmates
the most helpful is the handbook i can know about what my majors assessment is and i also can know the teaching structure of the engineering management
if the time is not enough the teacher will help you answer the questions after class until you really understand
in china many teachers are boring and rigid in their lectures
if it is not a major principle problem i think it may be good to listen to others
duringtwo months i am more close to the group members because of the group work
as for a feedback i want to see if that possible to give an overview of technology in the professionals area with a wide range such as ai and intelligent manufacturing in global prospect it will give us a clearly demand in our future research
i have not been in this situation ever but i know some engineering often cheat their boss when their boss ask them to buy some materials
in the future study i promise that i will never do anything contrary to the rae ethical principles
i believein myself that i can do it
the teacher  s interaction with us is short but they can pass on the most important information to us
ithink that in this case people need to learn from other culture
another way is to let them understand the responsibilityon their shoulder and how bad it is to fail their teammates
first of all you must have a good understanding of everyone on the team because this is the basis for cooperation with them
and i have to say there are truly many differences between my bachelor in china and msc in york such as1in china every course has a textbook which is almost the content of your study and exam while in york learning is based on a lot of reading before class and slides in the teachers classtherefore in order to understand the content of the teachers lecture i had to read much relevant materials
interacting with so many international students during my first term here was really fun
there are many things to do
the main differences are that we all come from different perspectives of working and different point of view due to we most of us come from different countriescultures but i think this will teach us a lot and we will learn how to work with different type of people
learning strategieshow to reasonably arrange your study time and entertainment time is a big challenge4
because chinese education is centered on the management of teachers which makes us lose a lot of opportunities for practice and exploration so i hope that british schools can give us more time for selflearning so that we can fully explore the limits of the brain and exercise our own thinking ability
yes the teaching style is my ideal style
then a large number of notes will appear relatively confusing which makes it impossible for me to see the meaning and logical structure that the lecturers want to express
being able to focus my time and energy on highvalue things is a symbol to turn into a productive person and it will be a must for me to become a distinction grade student
because for me the previous learning method did not involve this type of homework at all and i need to find a lot of information to complete this task
authoritarian could kill the creativity
it can be unsuccessful if the members of the group are unwilling to take an equal share fo the workload
compared with guest lecturers from outside the uni lectures were easy to understand in terms of the language for my standard
the lecturer who teaches us strategic management always give us lively and interesting class
actually it is a small behaviour due to different reasons but i believe that late is unreasonable and not respect tutors and other students
i expect that i can improve my critical thinking and spoken english
it is a goodway to improve my english
the most helpful aspect is how to corporate with group members and how to be a leader to support the development of the group
i was very lucky to be one of the twothe seminar began at 9 amso we booked the flight at 7 ambefore the daybut i was so excited that i slept little that nightand the next morning i woke up late at around 6 oclockit needed 40 minute from my home to airportso i felt very nervousand run out from my home in a hurry
knowledge points correspond to background questions
i started my masters and start taking notes on diary then i realized that is not enough because in the uk masters system has report writing and assessments for which i need skills of ms word and i need to strong grip on ms word so i start making notes on ms word and start highlighting with red color so i keep in mind those points while reading slides and lectures and now because of this step in am progressing positively in making my assessment my methods and way of taking notes and organizingnote down things that the instructor says more than oncebe selective don  t take down every single note take down the main points of the lecture or discussionhandwritten notes work best for classes that have to do withon your computer make sure that you have one folder for your notes from each different classkeep all the lecture and slides of that subject in that folder of subjectkeep all the syllabic and handouts for each class in the same place as your notes so that they are easily accessiblebe consistent
i try to make it shorter by writing the key words
once we needed to perform a short drama in class i was surprised to find that their performances were both excellent and they did bring me lots of fun
as amatter of fact students who get up at different times will have differentlearning time
i wonder if my skill is not strong enough to support me to take intact note but i gradually realized that some of my friends also couldnt do this thing very well
and this kind of evaluation system is very valuable for us to know where we should improve
in the lecture we usually ask some questions about it
theynever apply reductions in the marks for late deliveries3 commitment i feel that there is a lower sensation ofcommitment with the msc here in york from my classmates than my undergraduatescolleagues in my bachelors4 classrooms i have had some classes in theaterstyleclassrooms
because i learned many theories in my university i am not sure which situation is belongs to which theory
international business is a novelty course for me
every lecture makes it easy for me to understand and the instructor will connect each point in a humorous way to make it easier for me to accept
can cook well now8
my supervision group is greateveryone has different skills which can help us successand i think communication is essential for success
i always finish my notes and then put it aside
it really surprised me and i was really happy with the induction programmeit was a wonderful experience that i never had in china and there may be some changes in my way of learning but i cant name it immediately it takes time emerging
in english classes there are often guests to give lectures or introduce knowledge
first language issue
the differences between the university of york and the universities i went to in china are as follows1the teaching method is more relaxed than my previous school2tutors at the university of york are more relaxed3there are lots of interesting ways to teach at the university of york4my former college teachers would teach students more content in class5the atmosphere in my previous college classes was quite serious6comparing with my previous college there was less pressure to study7the university of york has a strong learning atmosphere8lectures at the university of york are more varied9the university of york has more group activities10my previous university paid more attention to class attendance
first this is different with my mahor when i was an undergraduate
of course i admit that these inductions give me plenty of help in study life as well as i really need some time to fit into british life
i think i can but there are some challenges may be faced by myself for example even though i will study knowledge and skill as much as possible but it is difficult to keep up the latest matter in time during my taught msc or working life however i will try my best to update professional skills timely
the main difference is that everyone in the group has strong characteristics nearly everyone has so many great strengths and good leadership
the first thing i gained from collaborative learning is communicationfrom my work in groups i knew that i need to learn to communicate with group memebers and understand thembecause there are different personalities in a group especially when there are memebers from different countires in a groupthis will create cultural differences so we need to communicate with each other and avoid conflicts that cultural differences bringthe second thing i gained from collaborative learning is toleranceif we have the attitude of tolerance when we do collaborative learning we can accept ideas and opinions from othersthis can make us learn somethin new really from others
i think the unity is the most essential factors to success in collaborative learning
each of us played very importantrole in order that the video will be recorded with success
i can understand the knowledge of each lesson and review it after class to absorb what i have learnedat the same time the content set in each lesson is connected there will not be many jumps
if the full score of the lecture is 10 i think it can reach 9
as a student i also aspire to be a distinction grade student
first communication is vital to the process of the group work
his lecture starts with general topicand objectives
for example the thinker oftenindependent thinking has the ability to brainstorm a leader has the abilityto lead a team to victory
i was one of the rebellious teenagers and i started to studyindependently in a city far from my parents when i entered universitytherefore i have enough grades to apply for this university fortunatelyin real life we always haveto spend a lot of time to communicate in the weekends and prove our gregarioushowever too long communication activities have compressed our own learningtime
the teaching and learning styles are very different with my previous studying
from my point of view the most surprised and helpful part is the supervision group
i prefer the way to marking our assignments in uk very muchfifthly almost all the students in china can pass the exam and graduate
first it should be my parents  support and trust
yesbecause i can learn both technical skill and generic skill
i think im very lucky with the team i got we are all from different countries from peru china and spain and i think that its going to help and teach us a lot from different cultures
some times it could be coldness of the weather that will make me to stop whatever reading i am doing and go to bed under coverthere was a time that through out the saturday i did not achieve the set target for the day simply because i was fixated on social media chatting with and video calling family members and loved back home in my home land
i think my groupmates are nice
besides i do think the critical thinking is really important our student should be critical to the konwledge we have learnt and always do the independent thinking and studying
i found the personal development framework most interesting and important
personally i think the biggest difficult to me is if i use my laptop to make notes then i have to improve my typing speed because it is very important
all of this can help me have a better life in the next year
i think the attitude and honesty are the most important factor of successful collaborative learning
sometimes i need to search somewords in dictionary and find out the meaning of words
i think it should be the characters of my teammates some of which are so positive and enthusiastic and it makes me feel more confident about our projects in the future
some reason like lazy behaviours internal contradictions no same goals etc
how do you stay focused
only after that i will do other things such as preparing for tomorrows class and reading the recommended books
i need to pay more tension in my homework than before
they were all unforgettable even though there were two man absent in the session and we met eacn other at the supervisor session
we should share our knowledge experienceand opinion with each other and promote the efficiency of group working
lecturer show us the example then i learn the method of answering the questions
i think confidence is the most important element to have when a presentation is given
many students are involved in lectures and they do not hesitate to ask questions
the worst case scenario is that i sometimes skipped the classes and went to play video game
first i gained unity awareness because we need to discuss and achieve every task together
i want to try to coordinate the member relations when there are argument about the assignment
now i have the confident that i can finish my report assignments with good writing skillsfourthly every question in the exam has the standard answer and seldom can we get the full mark unless our answer is the same as the standard answer
although in the past it violated statement but now know that thesituation in the premise i will be more careful about personal privacy andrespect for the work of partnersin the future development of theindividual i will strictly demand myself with the ethical statement as acriterion to prevent the above situation from happening again
law for engineering management is new for me as a course
there were some discussions and a lot of interactions between speakers and audience
absolutely yes but for mea chinese student the big problem is we used the totally different language before my only concern about the report and essay things like that i need to write in english im afraid of the grammar and so on
in the past usually four or more people share one room
therefore we must learn to refuse and do something that is important to you
i am expected about the final project but i am not sure i can do well with it because this project needs everyone in my group to make effort together
students only need to spend money to buy a lot of homework and to ensure high scores no need to spend time to write homework
in my last degree i just had many practice to do but in york i have to write essays9
however i think it is an interesting exercise because you can share your ideas and knowlege with the other classmates and improve your abilities in explaining thinks to the others and be able to use others ideas with yours
the site you give us should be an english language siteinsert your link below
teamwork need to convince everyone to target the common dedication
for example there was a problem with the computer
firstly i often have one item on the list that is hanging over my head and just doesn  t seem like it will get taken care of
but there are still many personal problems that need to be addressed1
second i have worked for one year in foxconnwhich belongs to manufacturing industry
so far i am dealingwell with the work given by the different modules
if every member wants to get a distinguished degree they can devote themselves to it wholeheartedly
teaching facilities after years of development of science and technology the evaluation standard of teaching facilities has been divided into two parts software and hardware
actually i had ever seen a situation that happened in my city in china
1 clear outline2
sometimes i dont understand my notes very well when i read them because i may not remember the example that the teacher said at that time
maybe in the future i should try harder to change my mind and learn more about the advanced knowledgesince i have recognised some of my problems i should overcome my shortcomings and make more efforts to get the distinction
tutors do not give you some simple contents rather than some model or strategies that you will need during homework so it is critical for our reports7
basicallybecause his objectives sometimes are not clear when he starts his lecturehowever his lectures are not boring because he uses a lot of his skill ofhumor and he teaches us with examples
this does not necessarily mean that each person should complete the same amount of work or same amount of ours
and with my classmates who are from a different background including different age working experience nation and family
