only in this way can improve the efficiency in teamwork
first i realized that the group members need to communicate
but here the group work has a very important position throughout the semester
a completely different teaching style the teaching method here is more flexible and more practical
i think each lesson was helping me in different aspects
speaking of bad habits all of us want to be perfect we all do not want bad habits but it is impossible that there is someone who do not have bad habits even a saint
to talk about coping with the academic work as of now i have been just following the lectures and notes then and there and also solving some example sheets for some of my modules
negative behavior occurs for avariety of personal reasons
such as they are smart they have a strong ability to remember andthey can solve problems in a new and creative way such as they can using somelearning tools to assist their learning
i think this method is really effective
i hope that we can have some challenges in the future group work
although most chinese students are not willing to take the initiative to answer the teachers questions they still take notes and listen carefully
it is worth mentioning that all lectures are relevant for example recently most of classes are involved in how to perform in a presentation
however i found that the teaching style is totally different in uk
the first thing is although i have studiedfor my premaster degree last year i can not stand some english habit whichmeans i can not complete get involved into uk culture
then i will usein my job when i am going to face with similar problems
i think the difficult one to achieve is present and review theory evidence and interpretation honestly accurately objectively and without bias which from the raes statement of ethical principles
the content of our lecture refers to many aspects
i liked the way how the lecture is being presented with claritycontent design and simplicitythe way they get connected while making the presentation making the class lively interactive and engagingand the body language
i think their proper eye contact is one of the most valuable things i can learn from them
therefore there will be insufficient library space at the end of the period
my notes helped me to pin point my problems and videos helped me to solve my confusion
language barrier
to behonest i do not really understand the problemresearchevidence and background knowledge are based on the theory of predecessors andpractical operation after the summary and then be absorbed by us as the secondsourceso in myopinion there are different interesting research evidence in differentlectures but they are all designed to help students better understand thetheoryto sum upmost historical background knowledge is boring but their significance isprofound not only in teaching but also in human development
during my taught msc i should make sure to keep the knowledge and skills up to date
professor joanna used mexican wave
this idea surprised me and we did successfully ultimately
as the festival was approaching i chatted late with my friends about the festivals the night before so it was two hours later than the scheduled wakeup time
the structure of each lecture is really nice
after receiving cooperative learning tasks team members do not talk or discuss with each other they work alone and do not really participate in the cooperationthis phenomenon often results in unsuccessful cooperationor we dont have enough time to prepare
from a lecture to lecture basis the lectures have followed a sensible order where each lecture build on knowledge learned in the previous lectures
people needs to learn to adhere thatpeople can have a better achieve in goals and have better life what we want
all of the team members need to have a sense of responsibility that we lead the group together to gain mutual benefits to achieve the common goal everyone is the leader in the group
however i also found some students would be distracted because of smartphone or something like that
those different styles are not only attractive but also develop my abilities like critical analysis logical thinking and establishing structure6
written assignments account for a large proportion and handson practices can only be done frequently by some competitions or project groups set up by teachers
it means that the lecturers and the msc directors are working to improve the msc content
actually i am worried that i can not integrate into the school life better and faster
however every time when i finished the dinner i just want to lie on my bed and play mobile phones or watch youtube videos instead of walking to my desk sit down and start learning
every day i should have a clear time plan and strictly follow the study plan
the studying and living environments are very different to formerfor studying environment first of all the studying style is not same
a common technique used by lecturers is：1excellent opening remarks：the opening should attract students attention build trust with students create a positive atmosphere and establish a positive image of the lecturer2a valid conclusion：summarize the main points at the end
there are so many things i can learn from observing their delivery such as how to get eyecontact with your audiences how to interact with them
as to the learning style i think it is more selflearning things than learning things from the lectures
therefore i not only expect to graduate successfully but also expect to get higher scores
tons of background knowledge i haveobserved and learned during the course
the lecturers care about students feeling and often ask students sitting behind to confirm if they can hear clearly or not
the lecture flew logically generally but it would be better if the lectuere can review the content of last class at the startsome of the lecturers are humourous such as bidyut and international businese lecturer sorry i do not his nameall lecturers are good in the respect of helping me move from one point to the next
the lectures are so interactive and hence we could get a better idea about the topics discussed during the class
so after class i need spent more time to review the content and understand the content what the lecturers said during the classes
the whole day was thus disrupted
for instance we recordedour promotional video about our business idea
although em belongs to the electronics institute it is quite different from the my universitys engineering major
in order to be more likely to succeed it is also important to ensure that more attention is given to subjects that are found difficult rather than spending all of ones time on those that one finds the easiest as this will mean that one will obtain a more wellrounded knowledge with which to complete assignments
he used the simple wordsand told me do not use any difficult words
now the feedbacks of lectures are very important and useful which can help me to understand the theories but i received the feedback rarely before7
i expected more interaction at masters level compared to bachelors
all of lecturers are using eyetoeye contact skills and writing down some significant points or drawing some diagram on the white board to make their lectures easier to understandbut a few lectures are not so good at description
leadership is a very important skill in group work so if i want to become a leader i must improve my english as soon as possible
in order to let thestudents review at home i felt that i had enough knowledge that i could getgood grades
but when i was trying to do some review simple keywords are not so efficient to revive my memories
each one expressed their point of view
its not too much which might waste some time and make students fell nervous
weijia huang is creative and active
thirdly sometimesi could not manage my time well it is really hard to achieve the worklifebalancefor example i need to go to the gym but i also need to do my homework i couldnot separate the time to both of them and finally i only can finish one thingthat would makes me lowproductive and makes me feel bad
cooperating with others enables me to learn a lot such as team awareness or learning strengths from others may be a careful and meticulous habit may be the unique thinking perspectives may be the spirit of persistence which i could not learn from independent study
however in this level i learned that we will have more group activities
i only read something in the textbook before4
because everyone may have different opinions when dealing with different problems it is also important to learn to persuade others
half contents are in the slides
the reasons are complicated but i think one of the primary causes might be the structure and method of teaching completely different from the previous degree that ive done already
of course it surprised me
i learned how to use mind mapping and key points to take notes from 4weeks presessional programme
didnt allocate the task clearly
learning spanish is very funny because the pronounce is comfortable and melodious
i should spend a lot of time every day on homework research the expansion of additional knowledge and language skills improvement
its not always that situation but in cases where the teachers ask something in the class and anybody can answer to the question and me even after knowing the answer i tend to keep quiet
but as a student i think the hardest part is to maintain accuracy and not mislead others
i heart from my classmates that some students are selfish and arrogant and refuse to cooperate with others these behaviors will hinder success
its easy for me to getcaught up in the trouble of not having to start for example driving acomputer staring at a problem and still have no answer for half an hour
in future modules try to use teamwork as much as possible
the lecture which showed the way to write is very useful
we have been asked to play a short drama or take a video to record our experiment
however this small aspect generally does not enter the entire group of seminars
in other words basically i am too hesitating i think too much because afraid of failure and i don want to regret in the future
in studying my teammates are good at different things like a person is good at accounting which i can learn
the most important thing is to help me understand my classmates and make new friends
however some people speak english well and their speaking is great which surprises meas for mei expect i can improve my confident and maintain my speaking in some activitiesas for the department i wish the organization can hold many events and activities for students in order to make chinese students to adjust study and life
i really need to take notes because i use to quickly forget things that i dont practice a lot
but most of the time we take it seriouslyto my surprise although most of the class are chinese students like me we are very willing to communicate with classmates from other countries and get along well with each other
my study plan is also not very different from the schools overview
therefore we can get a better result
i remember in my childhood there was a huge bridge in my hometown established by many engineering managers and workers but the materials and structure of the bridge didnt come up with national standards
i neverconsidered this as a problem because i thought we were just doing some smalltalk
