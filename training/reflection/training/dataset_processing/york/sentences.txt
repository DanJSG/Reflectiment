maybe in the future i should try harder to change my mind and learn more about the advanced knowledgesince i have recognised some of my problems i should overcome my shortcomings and make more efforts to get the distinction
of course it surprised me
the content of my first degree study is electrical engineering and automation
i learned how to use mind mapping and key points to take notes from 4weeks presessional programme
compared with guest lecturers from outside the uni lectures were easy to understand in terms of the language for my standard
as a student i also aspire to be a distinction grade student
teaching facilities after years of development of science and technology the evaluation standard of teaching facilities has been divided into two parts software and hardware
in china many teachers are boring and rigid in their lectures
the first thing is although i have studiedfor my premaster degree last year i can not stand some english habit whichmeans i can not complete get involved into uk culture
now the varieties of homework are different which make the study interesting but i did the same type of homework in most courses before6
however this small aspect generally does not enter the entire group of seminars
i expect that i can improve my critical thinking and spoken english
the lectures are so interactive and hence we could get a better idea about the topics discussed during the class
if it is not a major principle problem i think it may be good to listen to others
authoritarian could kill the creativity
the most helpful is the handbook i can know about what my majors assessment is and i also can know the teaching structure of the engineering management
actually it is a small behaviour due to different reasons but i believe that late is unreasonable and not respect tutors and other students
sometimes i need to search somewords in dictionary and find out the meaning of words
however some time i find i just copy the ppt and i paid too much attention on writing without hearing what teachers said
weijia huang is creative and active
i also read lots of documents and reports although it is tutor asked us to read
i need to pay more tension in my homework than before
my supervision group is greateveryone has different skills which can help us successand i think communication is essential for success
i think i can but there are some challenges may be faced by myself for example even though i will study knowledge and skill as much as possible but it is difficult to keep up the latest matter in time during my taught msc or working life however i will try my best to update professional skills timely
tons of background knowledge i haveobserved and learned during the course
i started my masters and start taking notes on diary then i realized that is not enough because in the uk masters system has report writing and assessments for which i need skills of ms word and i need to strong grip on ms word so i start making notes on ms word and start highlighting with red color so i keep in mind those points while reading slides and lectures and now because of this step in am progressing positively in making my assessment my methods and way of taking notes and organizingnote down things that the instructor says more than oncebe selective don  t take down every single note take down the main points of the lecture or discussionhandwritten notes work best for classes that have to do withon your computer make sure that you have one folder for your notes from each different classkeep all the lecture and slides of that subject in that folder of subjectkeep all the syllabic and handouts for each class in the same place as your notes so that they are easily accessiblebe consistent
those different styles are not only attractive but also develop my abilities like critical analysis logical thinking and establishing structure6
the studying and living environments are very different to formerfor studying environment first of all the studying style is not same
i just talked about three part of this topic
my study plan is also not very different from the schools overview
firstly i often have one item on the list that is hanging over my head and just doesn  t seem like it will get taken care of
cooperating with others enables me to learn a lot such as team awareness or learning strengths from others may be a careful and meticulous habit may be the unique thinking perspectives may be the spirit of persistence which i could not learn from independent study
second a coordinator who can lead the meeting and whois going to establish the rules
the lecture flew logically generally but it would be better if the lectuere can review the content of last class at the startsome of the lecturers are humourous such as bidyut and international businese lecturer sorry i do not his nameall lecturers are good in the respect of helping me move from one point to the next
only after that i will do other things such as preparing for tomorrows class and reading the recommended books
the teacher  s interaction with us is short but they can pass on the most important information to us
then a large number of notes will appear relatively confusing which makes it impossible for me to see the meaning and logical structure that the lecturers want to express
the teaching and learning styles are very different with my previous studying
each of us played very importantrole in order that the video will be recorded with success
and relying on these questions i can understand the knowledge deeply
teachers would interact with the classmates
now the feedbacks of lectures are very important and useful which can help me to understand the theories but i received the feedback rarely before7
such as they are smart they have a strong ability to remember andthey can solve problems in a new and creative way such as they can using somelearning tools to assist their learning
actually i am worried that i can not integrate into the school life better and faster
in fact i have now been in york studying for four months and i adapt to study and life well
in studying my teammates are good at different things like a person is good at accounting which i can learn
first this is different with my mahor when i was an undergraduate
the most helpful aspect is how to corporate with group members and how to be a leader to support the development of the group
i can always provide creative ideas and help when they need5
now i have the confident that i can finish my report assignments with good writing skillsfourthly every question in the exam has the standard answer and seldom can we get the full mark unless our answer is the same as the standard answer
first communication is vital to the process of the group work
i should spend a lot of time every day on homework research the expansion of additional knowledge and language skills improvement
but there are still many personal problems that need to be addressed1
how do you stay focused
i hope that we can have some challenges in the future group work
i was very lucky to be one of the twothe seminar began at 9 amso we booked the flight at 7 ambefore the daybut i was so excited that i slept little that nightand the next morning i woke up late at around 6 oclockit needed 40 minute from my home to airportso i felt very nervousand run out from my home in a hurry
the first thing i gained from collaborative learning is communicationfrom my work in groups i knew that i need to learn to communicate with group memebers and understand thembecause there are different personalities in a group especially when there are memebers from different countires in a groupthis will create cultural differences so we need to communicate with each other and avoid conflicts that cultural differences bringthe second thing i gained from collaborative learning is toleranceif we have the attitude of tolerance when we do collaborative learning we can accept ideas and opinions from othersthis can make us learn somethin new really from others
in future modules try to use teamwork as much as possible
for example the thinker oftenindependent thinking has the ability to brainstorm a leader has the abilityto lead a team to victory
i think confidence is the most important element to have when a presentation is given
the lecturers care about students feeling and often ask students sitting behind to confirm if they can hear clearly or not
theyre not nerds
however i know that our time is limited i need to usecollaborative learning in order to grasp the theory very well
this idea surprised me and we did successfully ultimately
firstly i should learn about thecourse information
this does not necessarily mean that each person should complete the same amount of work or same amount of ours
its not always that situation but in cases where the teachers ask something in the class and anybody can answer to the question and me even after knowing the answer i tend to keep quiet
after receiving cooperative learning tasks team members do not talk or discuss with each other they work alone and do not really participate in the cooperationthis phenomenon often results in unsuccessful cooperationor we dont have enough time to prepare
as to the learning style i think it is more selflearning things than learning things from the lectures
theynever apply reductions in the marks for late deliveries3 commitment i feel that there is a lower sensation ofcommitment with the msc here in york from my classmates than my undergraduatescolleagues in my bachelors4 classrooms i have had some classes in theaterstyleclassrooms
1 clear outline2
i think im very lucky with the team i got we are all from different countries from peru china and spain and i think that its going to help and teach us a lot from different cultures
every lecture makes it easy for me to understand and the instructor will connect each point in a humorous way to make it easier for me to accept
the worst case scenario is that i sometimes skipped the classes and went to play video game
i think my groupmates are nice
the main differences are that we all come from different perspectives of working and different point of view due to we most of us come from different countriescultures but i think this will teach us a lot and we will learn how to work with different type of people
in my last degree i just had many practice to do but in york i have to write essays9
first i realized that the group members need to communicate
i will pull out all stops
the reasons are complicated but i think one of the primary causes might be the structure and method of teaching completely different from the previous degree that ive done already
only in this way can improve the efficiency in teamwork
it is a goodway to improve my english
i liked the way how the lecture is being presented with claritycontent design and simplicitythe way they get connected while making the presentation making the class lively interactive and engagingand the body language
i only read something in the textbook before4
in english classes there are often guests to give lectures or introduce knowledge
from a lecture to lecture basis the lectures have followed a sensible order where each lecture build on knowledge learned in the previous lectures
each one expressed their point of view
interacting with so many international students during my first term here was really fun
i was one of the rebellious teenagers and i started to studyindependently in a city far from my parents when i entered universitytherefore i have enough grades to apply for this university fortunatelyin real life we always haveto spend a lot of time to communicate in the weekends and prove our gregarioushowever too long communication activities have compressed our own learningtime
from my point of view the most surprised and helpful part is the supervision group
i mean this lecture are lack of some clear slides
i can understand the knowledge of each lesson and review it after class to absorb what i have learnedat the same time the content set in each lesson is connected there will not be many jumps
i think this method is really effective
learning spanish is very funny because the pronounce is comfortable and melodious
ithink that in this case people need to learn from other culture
the whole day was thus disrupted
i really need to take notes because i use to quickly forget things that i dont practice a lot
in the past usually four or more people share one room
in the lecture we usually ask some questions about it
i expected more interaction at masters level compared to bachelors
every day i should have a clear time plan and strictly follow the study plan
as i have to listen to many lectures given by teachers every weekday i found teachers use the presentation skills into the lectures skillfully
therefore i not only expect to graduate successfully but also expect to get higher scores
i try to make it shorter by writing the key words
the content of our lecture refers to many aspects
as for a feedback i want to see if that possible to give an overview of technology in the professionals area with a wide range such as ai and intelligent manufacturing in global prospect it will give us a clearly demand in our future research
why we study is for me get great power to support me to do more valuable things
as the festival was approaching i chatted late with my friends about the festivals the night before so it was two hours later than the scheduled wakeup time
and also i have never got the habit of doing things in prior i always plan it in a way so that i can submit the reports before the deadline
although in the past it violated statement but now know that thesituation in the premise i will be more careful about personal privacy andrespect for the work of partnersin the future development of theindividual i will strictly demand myself with the ethical statement as acriterion to prevent the above situation from happening again
so after class i need spent more time to review the content and understand the content what the lecturers said during the classes
in the future study i promise that i will never do anything contrary to the rae ethical principles
duringtwo months i am more close to the group members because of the group work
i believein myself that i can do it
of coursei believe that i can perform well in the aspects of these principles as an engineering manager
the attributes of these courses mean that we need to read more articles
however every time when i finished the dinner i just want to lie on my bed and play mobile phones or watch youtube videos instead of walking to my desk sit down and start learning
preview is important here
i learn how to take buses recognize roads remember landmarks and so on
a common technique used by lecturers is：1excellent opening remarks：the opening should attract students attention build trust with students create a positive atmosphere and establish a positive image of the lecturer2a valid conclusion：summarize the main points at the end
this is the most different thing
as amatter of fact students who get up at different times will have differentlearning time
professor joanna used mexican wave
students only need to spend money to buy a lot of homework and to ensure high scores no need to spend time to write homework
the teacher will ask open questions to arouse students thinking
learning strategieshow to reasonably arrange your study time and entertainment time is a big challenge4
the structure of each lecture is really nice
in terms of learning methods it is necessary to profoundly understand the goals and intentions of the course content setting of each course grasp the key points of the teachers class content and strictly exclude all external factors in the learning attitude and concentrate on the energy in a certain period of time
there are many things to do
absolutely yes but for mea chinese student the big problem is we used the totally different language before my only concern about the report and essay things like that i need to write in english im afraid of the grammar and so on
the lecturer who teaches us strategic management always give us lively and interesting class
these learning processes are something i have not experienced before
personally i think the biggest difficult to me is if i use my laptop to make notes then i have to improve my typing speed because it is very important
first of all you must have a good understanding of everyone on the team because this is the basis for cooperation with them
for example our supervisor will give us instructive suggestion about our programme works and career in the future the language central is open to public and this will facilitate our international students
the lecture which showed the way to write is very useful
people needs to learn to adhere thatpeople can have a better achieve in goals and have better life what we want
if the time is not enough the teacher will help you answer the questions after class until you really understand
during i get along with mu supervision groupi find that all my group members are very outstandingand some of them have lots of working experiencesi think i can acquire many knowledge when i work with my groupas we just work together for two timesthey might have some strengths and weakness i havent find nowbut we have lots of chance to work together that we can learn more from each other which can help us to become better than before and help us to achieve our goals togetherin the collaborative learningi think a good communication is very important to let the other know your ideabesides thatlearn how to compromise also play an important part in the teamworkit can make the collaboration more efficient
although em belongs to the electronics institute it is quite different from the my universitys engineering major
it is worth mentioning that all lectures are relevant for example recently most of classes are involved in how to perform in a presentation
they are kindly to help us and tech us how to be better than before
for instance we recordedour promotional video about our business idea
besides i do think the critical thinking is really important our student should be critical to the konwledge we have learnt and always do the independent thinking and studying
teamwork need to convince everyone to target the common dedication
basicallybecause his objectives sometimes are not clear when he starts his lecturehowever his lectures are not boring because he uses a lot of his skill ofhumor and he teaches us with examples
because chinese education is centered on the management of teachers which makes us lose a lot of opportunities for practice and exploration so i hope that british schools can give us more time for selflearning so that we can fully explore the limits of the brain and exercise our own thinking ability
break down a difficult task into several parts to save time and then you can assign different roles
i will also go to the library to borrow some books related to the profession to expand my knowledge
so far i am dealingwell with the work given by the different modules
i want to try to coordinate the member relations when there are argument about the assignment
because i learned many theories in my university i am not sure which situation is belongs to which theory
there are so many things i can learn from observing their delivery such as how to get eyecontact with your audiences how to interact with them
it takes a lot of time for traveling
in order to let thestudents review at home i felt that i had enough knowledge that i could getgood grades
international business is a novelty course for me
of course i admit that these inductions give me plenty of help in study life as well as i really need some time to fit into british life
but as a student i think the hardest part is to maintain accuracy and not mislead others
during my taught msc i should make sure to keep the knowledge and skills up to date
my notes helped me to pin point my problems and videos helped me to solve my confusion
and this kind of evaluation system is very valuable for us to know where we should improve
if some members have problems they can ask other member for help
first language issue
we should share our knowledge experienceand opinion with each other and promote the efficiency of group working
its not too much which might waste some time and make students fell nervous
although most chinese students are not willing to take the initiative to answer the teachers questions they still take notes and listen carefully
half contents are in the slides
yesbecause i can learn both technical skill and generic skill
the main difference is that everyone in the group has strong characteristics nearly everyone has so many great strengths and good leadership
in order to be more likely to succeed it is also important to ensure that more attention is given to subjects that are found difficult rather than spending all of ones time on those that one finds the easiest as this will mean that one will obtain a more wellrounded knowledge with which to complete assignments
so that i think there will be a competition or discussion when we need to choose a group leader
but when i was trying to do some review simple keywords are not so efficient to revive my memories
i still remember in junior high school on thewinter vacation there were lots of homework
however i found that the teaching style is totally different in uk
i heart from my classmates that some students are selfish and arrogant and refuse to cooperate with others these behaviors will hinder success
to talk about coping with the academic work as of now i have been just following the lectures and notes then and there and also solving some example sheets for some of my modules
we have been asked to play a short drama or take a video to record our experiment
knowledge points correspond to background questions
i think their proper eye contact is one of the most valuable things i can learn from them
its easy for me to getcaught up in the trouble of not having to start for example driving acomputer staring at a problem and still have no answer for half an hour
because everyone may have different opinions when dealing with different problems it is also important to learn to persuade others
negative behavior occurs for avariety of personal reasons
first i gained unity awareness because we need to discuss and achieve every task together
and with my classmates who are from a different background including different age working experience nation and family
however in this level i learned that we will have more group activities
i wonder if my skill is not strong enough to support me to take intact note but i gradually realized that some of my friends also couldnt do this thing very well
then i will usein my job when i am going to face with similar problems
leadership is a very important skill in group work so if i want to become a leader i must improve my english as soon as possible
it can be unsuccessful if the members of the group are unwilling to take an equal share fo the workload
there were some discussions and a lot of interactions between speakers and audience
therefore there will be insufficient library space at the end of the period
they were all unforgettable even though there were two man absent in the session and we met eacn other at the supervisor session
i have observed this from a very young age of mine that when i am needed to speak something i mostly tend to remain silent
itfeels good to be back to school after five years of working but it also feelsquite weird at the same time
sometimes i dont understand my notes very well when i read them because i may not remember the example that the teacher said at that time
therefore we can get a better result
i am organizing my notes to show levels of significance by marking the significant information according to its significance
therefore we must learn to refuse and do something that is important to you
yes the teaching style is my ideal style
the most important thing is to help me understand my classmates and make new friends
all of lecturers are using eyetoeye contact skills and writing down some significant points or drawing some diagram on the white board to make their lectures easier to understandbut a few lectures are not so good at description
another way is to let them understand the responsibilityon their shoulder and how bad it is to fail their teammates
i think the attitude and honesty are the most important factor of successful collaborative learning
to behonest i do not really understand the problemresearchevidence and background knowledge are based on the theory of predecessors andpractical operation after the summary and then be absorbed by us as the secondsourceso in myopinion there are different interesting research evidence in differentlectures but they are all designed to help students better understand thetheoryto sum upmost historical background knowledge is boring but their significance isprofound not only in teaching but also in human development
when i back to the dorm afterthe party it was very late
when i start to process my undergraduate i was barely taking notes
i like the comfortable and relaxed atmosphere of induction
but for me maybe ill choose to turn off the alarm clock and go back to sleep until 10 or even 11 which will cost me a whole morning to do something meaningful
being able to focus my time and energy on highvalue things is a symbol to turn into a productive person and it will be a must for me to become a distinction grade student
if the full score of the lecture is 10 i think it can reach 9
many students are involved in lectures and they do not hesitate to ask questions
i think the unity is the most essential factors to success in collaborative learning
second i have worked for one year in foxconnwhich belongs to manufacturing industry
some times it could be coldness of the weather that will make me to stop whatever reading i am doing and go to bed under coverthere was a time that through out the saturday i did not achieve the set target for the day simply because i was fixated on social media chatting with and video calling family members and loved back home in my home land
in other words basically i am too hesitating i think too much because afraid of failure and i don want to regret in the future
at present i think my group members are very thoughtful and have strong executive ability
but most of the time we take it seriouslyto my surprise although most of the class are chinese students like me we are very willing to communicate with classmates from other countries and get along well with each other
i always finish my notes and then put it aside
a completely different teaching style the teaching method here is more flexible and more practical
because for me the previous learning method did not involve this type of homework at all and i need to find a lot of information to complete this task
it really surprised me and i was really happy with the induction programmeit was a wonderful experience that i never had in china and there may be some changes in my way of learning but i cant name it immediately it takes time emerging
law for engineering management is new for me as a course
his lecture starts with general topicand objectives
i think it should be the characters of my teammates some of which are so positive and enthusiastic and it makes me feel more confident about our projects in the future
i remember in my childhood there was a huge bridge in my hometown established by many engineering managers and workers but the materials and structure of the bridge didnt come up with national standards
tutors do not give you some simple contents rather than some model or strategies that you will need during homework so it is critical for our reports7
but here the group work has a very important position throughout the semester
so we should do the work as soon as possible and then go to other activities not only to improve the quality of learning but also to avoid missing the deadline
he used the simple wordsand told me do not use any difficult words
i think each lesson was helping me in different aspects
jin is a chinese student who worked for 5 years before come here
from the team work 1 we can exchange the idea of one issue in order to understand the issue roundly
all of the team members need to have a sense of responsibility that we lead the group together to gain mutual benefits to achieve the common goal everyone is the leader in the group
however i think it is an interesting exercise because you can share your ideas and knowlege with the other classmates and improve your abilities in explaining thinks to the others and be able to use others ideas with yours
first it should be my parents  support and trust
all of this can help me have a better life in the next year
i found the personal development framework most interesting and important
i hope i can learn more management in my mind em include whole information we should learn more skills and i think i will become a whole person by em because i will improve time management skill term work skill talking skill etc
thirdly sometimesi could not manage my time well it is really hard to achieve the worklifebalancefor example i need to go to the gym but i also need to do my homework i couldnot separate the time to both of them and finally i only can finish one thingthat would makes me lowproductive and makes me feel bad
it means that the lecturers and the msc directors are working to improve the msc content
lecturer show us the example then i learn the method of answering the questions
i think the difficult one to achieve is present and review theory evidence and interpretation honestly accurately objectively and without bias which from the raes statement of ethical principles
speaking of bad habits all of us want to be perfect we all do not want bad habits but it is impossible that there is someone who do not have bad habits even a saint
can cook well now8
written assignments account for a large proportion and handson practices can only be done frequently by some competitions or project groups set up by teachers
however i also found some students would be distracted because of smartphone or something like that
the differences between the university of york and the universities i went to in china are as follows1the teaching method is more relaxed than my previous school2tutors at the university of york are more relaxed3there are lots of interesting ways to teach at the university of york4my former college teachers would teach students more content in class5the atmosphere in my previous college classes was quite serious6comparing with my previous college there was less pressure to study7the university of york has a strong learning atmosphere8lectures at the university of york are more varied9the university of york has more group activities10my previous university paid more attention to class attendance
if every member wants to get a distinguished degree they can devote themselves to it wholeheartedly
once we needed to perform a short drama in class i was surprised to find that their performances were both excellent and they did bring me lots of fun
i have not been in this situation ever but i know some engineering often cheat their boss when their boss ask them to buy some materials
i anticipate we may encounter some problems when we undertake proper group work in the future however as personalities can clash and relying on other people to get things done can sometimes be quite daunting
some reason like lazy behaviours internal contradictions no same goals etc
i neverconsidered this as a problem because i thought we were just doing some smalltalk
for example there was a problem with the computer
for example some people want to adopt a strategy but other people want to adopt another strategy
actually i had ever seen a situation that happened in my city in china
the site you give us should be an english language siteinsert your link below
language barrier
however some people speak english well and their speaking is great which surprises meas for mei expect i can improve my confident and maintain my speaking in some activitiesas for the department i wish the organization can hold many events and activities for students in order to make chinese students to adjust study and life
in the market technology department the teacher has taught us a lot of methods of market analysis
i prefer the way to marking our assignments in uk very muchfifthly almost all the students in china can pass the exam and graduate
didnt allocate the task clearly
and i have to say there are truly many differences between my bachelor in china and msc in york such as1in china every course has a textbook which is almost the content of your study and exam while in york learning is based on a lot of reading before class and slides in the teachers classtherefore in order to understand the content of the teachers lecture i had to read much relevant materials
i am expected about the final project but i am not sure i can do well with it because this project needs everyone in my group to make effort together
by doing so i believe we will eventually get the best solution
and the guys from different cultural backgrounds are also very nice i saw that almost everytime the student who answered the teachers questions are these guys
for example different ways of doing things between members contradictions and differences in personality can all cause problems
all the lecturers are very cooperative in responding our questions in a more effective way and they try to answer briefly with some practical referencessothings getting easier for us and we can understand easily
the first thing is speaking out my mind bravely
although the homework is completed the quality of the work that has been rushed to complete is inevitably not high enough to carry out enough thinking to complete the workthe selfconsciousness of my study is not very strong
lecturers are very good at giving speeches
firstly i have never participated some games in a group during my courses beforeall of my teachers would like to teach us acknowledge rather than encourage us to find by ourselvessecondly i remember tony and other professors taught us some structure and development about engineering management that i do not know before
ive also learnt to be more proactive and do most of the things on my own
all of these can move the process for the lecture and are useful
but in york i need to collaborate with teammates i learnt how to communicate and define a group roles in group work which is a excellent experience4
i used to use the marker to focus on the parts that i dont understand and need to understand in my notes
more discussion might be helpful to the team work5
seek for help in times of difficulty
i also need to read the introductory and overview papers in my field that is the most basic things of this subject and know the basic concepts terms basic problems and basic analytical methods of this subject
when i need to take notes i usually use my own abbreviations torecord
second people who has leadership skills is critical to teamworkhe can be used as a cohesive force to lead everyone to learn and work
i hope that i can be more confident and have eye contact with the audience
it is more beneficial to study after each lecture to understand bit by bit
if i am defeated i could not feel disappointed
he is very positive he would like to speak every time when the teacher asked
what is morei need to cook for myself and do some recruitment activities
and then some guidances will be give by professor and use powerpoint to show define clearlyduring the whole presentation professor will use many examples to explain what they want to say which can help students to understand the theories
the lecturers will ask us some questions when a part of lectures was finished sometimes
and my classmates told me to prepare these things in advance
the team members strengths are good knowledge and hard work and as weaknesses i would say the capability to share opinions but its normal because we only know each other for a week and with time everything will improve
when i am coping with the academic work i always need to read some academic resource book
it  s much better to finish my week earlier on friday than it is to get stuck working on a lastminute projectone of my good habit is that i plan small goals for myself every day instead of a big impossible one
yes，it is good
it is important each members ofthe group express their ideas and sustain their ideas
sometimes team members delay the normalprogress of the plan due to laziness or other personal reasons thus delayingthe progress or the members of the group did not complete the assigned taskson time with high quality and quantity thus dragging down the overall qualityof the whole group or the uneven assignment of tasks affects the mood of theteam members or there is no clear plan not enough preparation resulting inthe failure of the task
so far the lectures were engaging ran without any problems and were easy to follow
among the team members before starting the task negotiate the content and objectives of the group cooperation the way to complete the task the criteria for evaluation and so on
as for dr jhons lecture since he usually only list some key point in word i often dont understand what he was going to talk about exactly
i then keep the notes from that week for each lecture in my bag and during my weekly review i skim through them and organise them into their respective modules and store them in plastic wallets in a folder
also i need to spend a huge amount of time asking somebody for help or dealing with these questions by myself
therefore i hope that i can overcome the fear of failure take the first step bravely try new work feel different environments and one day i will find my dream of being willing to work hard all my life
i thought it was very difficult at the time but i had plenty of time to prepare it about a month or so
the leader should know the task clearly and divided the work for everyone based on the specialty
sources httpswwwmindtoolscompagesmainnewmnhtehtma much betterorganized timetable i believe will make me experience less stress and avoid miss anything important
the lectures effect were good i can understand basically also learn knowledgethe lecturers speak clearly and they give us enough time to see the ppt
i was not a good person to manage time
and every single part have the connection with the next part so we can follow it logically and it is easy for us to follow it since we know what content we are going to learn
through my summary of myself it is enough to prove my desire to be a good studentin dealing with academics i am demanding myself with rigorous honest and hardworking standards
as there are so much group work to do i spend most of time with my group members i expect that we can be positive for our teamwork all the time and learn more things from each other
we can also record some places we do not know the class time is limited we need to pay attention to the lecture in class after class we can inquire about the knowledge of the material we do not knowill focus on some of the things that ive highlighted
at the same time everyone in the team can find the support point for the development of personal core competitiveness advocating an atmosphere of mutual trust and seamless cooperation
later i learned to simplify my notes and complete the notes after class which could increase course efficiency
after their answer students can also ask more if they do not understand the answeras for my questions i think teachers are quite patient and give me some useful answers and more help about my questions
to my surprised tutors always reply mails as soon as possible even if at 11pm which is really helpful for me and i am really movedin conclusion i have learnt lots of skills and abilities due to study during two mouths and i believe that i will learn more knowledge in next days
i think all of them are goodalex and alejandro are good at thinking of a new idea and sharing the idea with othersfenggao and sun are good at putting ideas into practicethey can provide me with new ideas to achieve your study goals
the biggest problem was that interacting with the audience is a very difficult task
from the course of management and marketing of technology some information what i mean is the evidence of research that i see is from ieee
secondly every member should help each other
besides if the information is really important i will change the colour from black to redin the future i will try to add more self thinking into my notes to help me improving the ability of critical thinking
during the class the majority of students were taking notes on their laptops and try to write down every key words which can remind them about what kinds of knowledge point they have obtained
i know this is a bad habit but i just can not overcome it
i have always been pleased with the quality and style of teaching at the university and have found it conducive to my learning
we do not need to accept the other idea superficially we need toanalyze it in depth
i think the course will meet my expectations
during the presectional language courses the tasks of class including the amount of tasks after class and the amount of tasks are relatively substantial except for some free time
in my supervisionqiqi is a really creative man who can always find out the efficient way to solve the problems and come up his ideas in a different wayso we used to ask his opinions before we made the final decisioni am the elder brother with more working and social experience in the groupso i usually came up my practical views to achieve the goals during the discussioni think the wellcommunication and openmind view sharing is the most important things for successful collaborative learning
do homework timely5
it would also influence me the challenges that i need to more focus on the principle during my taught msc
i am supprised that my classmates study hard in every lecture because nearly everyone want to get a distiniction degree
i am good at giving innovation ideas i can play an role help my teammates to create an special ideas
and the way to create app with audiokit is the specification of this course and also the basic knowledge to finish the course assessment
and i just need to have slight modification on the notes when i listen to the lecturer
it clearly points out what topic will be under consideration
thats the first thing i learned
i think maybe sometimes the allocation of team members is unreasonable
i believe that i will improve myself step by step in the future
part ii4the lewis model5when cultures collideleading across cultures nicholas brealey 2010 3rd ed but there is plenty of material easily available on the web
what i most want to get is the ability to speak
i am a little careless and dont care about the details
before i take from the lecturer i will think about the content of lecture and collect professional knowledge
teachers have stressed the importance of time management many times before the formal start of study
a team always be more intelligent and stronger than individuals2
when i have to finish my own academic work i pay more attention on extracting the points and paraphrase it by my own words after i read the literature
this kind of thing has been repeated for more than a month and i am easily flocked to the surrounding environment which is probably the biggest weakness in my study time
i have been in york studying for two months and the autumn term is going to finishi have adapted to the new living environment quicklyhoweverin the beginning i had difficulties in getting used to the new studying environmentthe most difficult thing is that there are many professional words in lectures that i did not know before which made me fail to acquire knowledge in lecturesafter these two months i have learnt lots of professional words about my major and improved my listening skill a lotso i can understand the content of lecture more easily than before
i also know that i have a lot of deficiencies in many aspects and i need to keep learning to cope with current learning
myparents send me to the uk to do my master study in order to expand my horizonand learn some useful knowledge
no
i expected that i can also take many notes such as the theory method module mentioned and my own understanding i think it must be helpful for my study
sometimes slides from lecture are not enough so i  m always using my notes simultaneously with the material provided by the lecturer
setting up a clear allocation of the individual part and a clear structure of the project
i thought their speeches were all better than me
i have mastered the research support materials and knowledge background of the course from these reading materials
in this semester our group finished a lot of homework and also saw some success of other groups
only two of them were absent for some reasons
however i hope that the background significance and case analysis of law class can add some supporting materials such as video or document to assist understanding
lectures can upload their slides into the vle
it may also be because there are too many people to protect the safety of students on campus7 homeworkas mentioned above most exams in china are conducted in the form of examination papers so are assignments
lack of cyber security awareness and rigour
as all the team members come from different countries and regionsour thinking modes are very differentso that we might have different views on the same thingand when we meet some problemswe have some different ways to deal with them
during this week i found that our course will learn commercial area not only engineering
therefore i realized that i should try to get rid of the habit ofstaying up late which is good for my study and lifenow i understand that as a postgraduate student i should maintain agood living habit and positive learning attitude
i really dont like to give up tasks
i like the design about the lecture
beside assignment i focus on having good time management on everything
another problem that i have encountered is that there are so many new words in classes such as law and management of technology which could cause that i can not make notes following teachers
i think it is interesting because there is an india teammate
they can help us learn a lot of knowledge
different individuals have behaviour
keep an open attitude to meet new life and make positive changes
so sometimes i do not want to talk academic work with tutor i do not want to ask question to tutorssecondly laziness and delay are not suitable for becoming a grade student
and of course demonstrate team spirit of of resilience determination and optimism
also we can always discuss some other activities or presentations about each lecture after class together with my group
for example sometimes i am addicted to social media i will spend a lot of time to modify my photos and reply my friends  comments because i care too much about how others think of me
as i said above i love any interesting interactions with my classmates and teachers within our class
i found library tips and referencing guide are most useful
i am nervous shy and not confident at all when i speak in public
i was surprised we did two teamwork challenges in first week
good zilin fan is a good listener and executorshe would be full heart on her task
at the same time all the classmates finish the group work in a high qualitywhich makes me very nervous about myself
in my opinion the content i have seen from the vle is useful for what it is they were going to talk about
so im curious about everything and i want to explore almost everything like parties making international friends going to the museum and other interesting activities
in addition in the process of learning it is easy to be interfered by external factors and can not concentrate on learning content which is also an important factor affecting the quality of learning
at the same time i also noticed that some students are using mobile phones during class
the second thing that gives me a deep impression is that there are only a few interactions between the professor and students in the course
we can get real collective achievementssum of the collective achievements rather than the individual performance and the team achievements should represent the achievements more than the sum of single parts
another example i want to list myself
before the start of courses i thought we will get close to each other in our class quicklybut now there are two thirds of classmates whose names i even cant call in our class
then if there are any factors in this it can affect the motivation of my study
however the form of homework is totally difference with i experienced in the past
the slides were clear and in a logical order
teaching or learning way is the same for me as before
i was coordinator of the meetingand i gave the opportunity to speak each member of group
more than the teacher communicates to preview the future course in advance and finally it may be because there is no hard work
for example we have 3 classes on tuesday afterthat i usually have a supervisor group meeting which usually last about 4 hoursall of the activities above cost me at least 7 hours
so i think i am not a good student in this aspectlet me talk about my desire to be a good student
as we only do some simple works its okay for us to have no division in our work so far but it will reduce our working efficiency in the near future and its a big challenge for us
i can still recall the day that in themanagement and marketing of technology class the battery of mic is totally deadso bidyut baruah tried so hard to shout out to get his voice heard
every course has their own specialty and each tutor has their own style of teaching
learningteaching resources software application are at at advanced stage making it different from the resources available during undergraduate3
i feelthat i am not effective notes taker
through 360degree evaluation my personality is a team worker
if i have a dilemma that there is a conflict between my interest or the companys interest and the engineering ethic it may be difficult for me to follow these principles
they were both logical and professional showed us the law in the uk step by step
i believe collaborative learning is the best way to get the best efficiency and good learning outcomes
i must admit i have not observed that many things about their behaviour
everyone should believe each other2
i think it is a good process of applying what you have learned into practice
i tend to feel tired after staying up late which willhave a negative impact on my enthusiasm for learning
i studied engineering ethics related courses at university
but i will make notes in the margins of the sides including the places i dont understand during the preview the emphasis part in the class and some knowledge points that i think need to be explored more after class
it is the teaching style i expectedi hope that the tutor can guide students to complete the study task in more detail
it is especially useful if making notes on a computer as i can reorganise information under new headings
we have just seen each other once or twice and i think everyone is helpful and smart
the perspective is more macro fromdomestic chinese research to worldwide comparison3
i must say that other students in my supervision group are very creative
firstly i listen the ted talk without any subtitles inthe begging
in addition i use different color pens to write the note in order to shoe levels of significant
the contents of the lectures are also audible
this is a challenging and interesting form in class
actually there are several modules are using the collaborative learning now and it also has good and bad aspects
however we need to learn and discover knowledge by ourselves here
and my movements were very tight
therefore in the following study i need to work hard to improve the initiative involvement and interest in learning
this has led to almost all children being forced to becomeexcellent students by their parents even being oppressed and deprived of theirfreedom of play and me time
i am happy with everything
however in uk i need to learn make a plan by my self
you have to tell them your problems in the first time that they will help you to solve them on time so that it wont affect the process
good communication is essential for group work
it will hurt your neckthirdly they look like very confident about the knowledge that teachers give us
in my group the division of labor is very clear
i lived and studied in a completely different environment
i am excited to learn new thing in totally different circumstance but also a bit worried about my math and programming skills
maybe the way to look at problems will be simpler but there will be no problem in general communication
another thing we can learn is that we everyone has different ideas we can learn some new thought from others when we are talking with them
the first and basic thing that i have learnt from them is the confidence that shows when give a lecture
so i think that no matter what kind of character we all need to listen to others opinions actively and give our own opinions that will help us do assignment better
for example when talking about branding the teacher will tell us what branding is and then give some examples
although i joined a lot of clubs and wanted to know more foreign friends to practice my speaking
from my experience the lectures have been well planned out
without reasonable cause i do feel that this would hinder a students learning
if theres anything that stuck out is bens curiosity and willingness to ask questions
whats more i try my best to record the important points in a brief way so that i spend only a little time in the writingas for the ways to show levels of significance i use pens of different colors to notify myself
honesty always good i think honesty is an important element in our life
i could clearly hear what the lecturer said even when i sat in the last row
yes i think this course is that i used to expect
in some module i could see some iota of background or residual knowledge on that particular module
they will use body language make eye contact with us and keep humor and humor
but i think it is necessary for me to improve me skills of this aspect
i also get clear about thatquestion because of his answer
more helpful activities is to help us to understand more other academic backgrounds such as phd across the academic lectures personally think that academic is shared in all areas there is no independent knowledge this is very important and often easy to forget if increase on the basis of these cultural changes such as the cross in the field of medicine and computer join different cultures in the british medical data contrast will be very interesting
for me this is the first time i face all theknowledge given by english instead of chinese
in living environment i think i am bad because i wanted to connect other culture and meet friends from different country but i didnt4
so i really aspire to be a distinction grade student
i will not use facebook social networking applications during study time and dont copy others homework or tests as well as plagiarism
6
groupsassignment also a very nice idea
in the process of cooperation let the team members understand the method academic exchanges then a better way to learn from each other to form a good study habit but also to allow the team members to learn to choose and judge what is useful correct the best concept and practice
my job responsibility is survey and design thelayout for optic fiber cable and transmission equipment
the difference is that we only have one teacher for one class but not two or three teachers taking turns
undoubtedly performance in class is the most important and the performance in class shows your concentration participation and understanding
the study in the uk is mostly for group study which gives me a lot of sense of participation and the learning efficiency has also been greatly improved
most important thing is we together make the group better and finally finish the jobto sum up i learn a lot of things from collaborative learning how to communicate but i need to learn a lot to become better
to be honest i am not satisfied with my coping with the academic work recently
it has been three years since i have kept myself away from the words “ essays ” “ assessments ” “ exams ” and mainly “ results ”
in group four every member are good at listening others thoughts and everyone has imagination but their weakness i havent found
but in york i need to complete group work i have to work with others and learn to work in teams5
the hardware part is dormitory classroom and multimedia equipment
well i agree that i really learn different abilities and skills after i started learning experience in university of york i find there are most changes exposed in my study and daily reading which will be shown as follow1
sell my or my group idea to a competition company
comparing with being surprised about the program im more anticipated and concerned about the following study
i think the group work activities are the most interesting and helpful which let me make friends with group members and learn how to work better in a group
i also improved on been less shy or scared to participate in class or give presentations
of course because i am not confident enough i am afraid that i am wrong it is not good for improving my english
commitmentpassionflexibilitycommunicationgood humour
2 i just needed to focus on the content of my teachers said and the powerpoint when i were in my first degree but now there are more opportunities to communicate with lectures during classes
i ecpected that we should be on time unless somethings emergent happens
and then i always am hesitation
even if some knowledge ihave learned before i still have some confuse by the specific terms
i think they are relevant with my study life and working life
and i was a little shy
i will not hesitate to express my ideas to other and hope to get their praise and recognition
distractions also occur in class
firstly there are differences inteaching methods
she like our friend rather than our lecturer in my eyes
there were severaltimes that we were trying to provide our customer with the best standard andquality but it would take more time than we all expected
well he is humorous and over moralistic sometimes a litter serious
i found that some ordinary students seem to have mastered high learning skills such as making ppt and writing documents
so i guess this is the path which will be the road for it
our own hometown isnt the same province in china however in hofsted theory we are all chinese have a common character in the 6d model 1st we are all in the highpower distance society
students from all over the world come together because of the same interests
this first and the most important thing for me is that i need to figure out what i want to tell the audiences
then there is a vicious circle
in the uk study the composition of the classdiscussion is large and more is to test teamwork
nexti want to describe one of my own experiences
the purpose of the plan is to sort the tasks to be performed each day fill the tasks into four quadrants and then do it efficiently as plannedi look forward to making progress in time management
but in uk professors prefer to give a guide for students we need to find the think we need4the form of report and essay
what a surprise act
4 the marks are given by submit a report at the end of a subject but it was usually a final exanimation back in old times
after two years my english geta good improve therefore i think my english will be better than now when i graduatefrom york i will keep a good attitude and work hard study hard to improvemyself
some students have a really good foundation in english because some of them have enough work experience and often use english in their work
for example we have course of law for engineering
yes there maybe some challenges in future group discussions
they can also use the internal translation so that they can understand what the lecturer taught immediately while i need to search the word after i go home
language
during the two months when i came to york i felt very happy
maybe
on the whole her course design is very detailed and perfect and her lecture style is also very humorous
in addition when the teacher asked questions the students reacted for a long time or chose to be silent but this may be because most of the students including me are from china because we have different education methods
dr bidyut s lectures were good delivered by himbecause he always ask us is it clear
if some questions are easy to solved they will rely quickly but if some questions is hard to say they never say they dont know or refusal they will try to solve the problem after lecture
specifically in the morning when there is no class schedule some excellent students will get up at 7 o clock
although this is my own responsibility it is a challenge for me
during the induction programmei know more methods that can help me to engage this major and the school as soon as possiblewe have our supervisor and he gave us some suggestion both associated with the study and life
haha most people from china would considerdescribe someone in the bad way behind their back is kind of rude behavior butsince it is confidential i  ll just put the blunt truth here
i am not a person who likes toshare everything with others
i still prefer my own method in studying
i am attending six courses and each day i have classesbetween one to three hours
communicating with group members is very important when working in a group
her style of teachingwas unique
in addition teamwork make us reaching goals faster and thinking comprehensively
besides collaborative learning needs the skills to cooperate well
i think the main difference in our team is different time management
in our team we have had argued
some minor drawbacks are that the expression of english is not very smooth
yes i like this kind of teaching method
psychoacoustics lecture and matlab workshop requires some degree of mathematical skills
working on my new developed skills can letme achieve my goals in a more efficient way and i can enjoy the journeyregarding the studying at the university i think i could successfully adapt tothe teaching style
and try to connect with the knowledge we learnt in the class such as swot
after class i can clearly remember the important content emphasized by the teacher when i see the notes
when the professor gives us opportunity for discussion they usually have some interesting idea
every time when we were after class there were many things that we need to learn it again to improve our understanding of knowledge
as an example i was surprised to have a talk on basic writing and research skills as i assume most students at this level would have complete a dissertation project
meanwhile i am also concerned that my old thinking patterns differ from those of the british that my professor can not more directly understand what i say
sometimes i feel nervous and can not express what i want to say with complete ease
but i think this is my own problem because when professor tws slides outline is very clear little word but show many informationjns is very attractive because she often smiles
sometimes in class i can not fully understand what the teacher says which is a big obstacle for my study
i think we chinese student need more participate in the question and answer part
yesof coursei really think the msc in em of york is totally different from my 4year studying experience in chinese university and i am very interested in the group work
for example it is understandable to be absent from a group meeting for physical reasons
but i cant give any commitment to my future work because after graduating id like to go back to china to find a job as we all known sometimes i cant make a choice by myself as an employee in addition it is also the challenge that i have to face to because if i follow the bosss order maybe i will stand on the unethical aspect
plagiarism may be ignored sometimes when i am writing essays
he is really humorous and always tells some jokes to catch our attention
all my team members are chinese so there is no challenges for us to work together
what kind of work that i can do sometime i dont know how to balance my life and work my time management i think i will improve these in this year
in order not to waste the work of others i must complete my work on time
this week i learned information about our subject
maybe some of the team members can not listen to other idea so that there might have conflict within the team2
first is
it just locks yourself down in your own world
however some jobs only need to extend the learning linearly without broadening it
i prefer to review my notes every two days to strengthen my memory and understanding
however there were some other students talked to each other about irrelevant topics
because in the past i used to write down every contents from slides like some other students and i didnt understand what the lecturers said
yes the teaching style is great
my classmates are all very excited to study new courses and some of them working really hard that studied during the midnight
there are some things i want to improve and to be a better person
they will have a video chat with me when i miss them and feel vulnerable
firstlyyou should raise their interests and they will concertrate on studythereforeit is necessary to broden some knowledge and insert some interesting images to describe and explain some academic wordssecondlytutors can combine theory with practice and explain some examples to uswhich is beneficial to us understand what he say
in the last two days i started towrite homework madly from 7 am to 12 pm except for the meal time
i personally feel that it is much easier to learn in school than work in a company
its a good opportunity foe me to get improved
in our group there are 5 people without me they are kind and we can get the same way in our goals in teamwork during the induction
some others majored in physics or electronic engineering
i think the questions that the lecturers focus on explanation are test questions or important questions
when i observed the lecturers i like their confidence
moreoverthe teaching mode and the way of think have a lot of differences
in the class i take notes sometimes for the lecturers always speak quickly
secondly communication with others is especially important and we should pay more attention to our ways of communication which means that we should keep patient and calm when others have different opinions with ours
so maybe i need to have a change
in my point the most helpful session is introduction to msc engineering managementwhich helped me to learn some study skills and experiencesespecially some experiences from phd students it is really useful for me
we should do the work allocation based on the abilities of team members4
however since i studied the premaster course in the university of york for one year i have a certain understanding of the academic requirements of the uk
in china only a few tasks are done in groups6
the education system is completely different when compare to my bachelors degree which i completed in indiathe way the lectures are being conducted here is totally different when compared to the lectures in india since it is mandatory to attend all the lectures therealso the way of teaching is different where in india all the concepts would be spoonfed the examination pattern and also the way of assessment is completely different since there are no courseworkessays as a part of our assessmentsthe grading system is also not the same as it is being done here since they use the cgpa where our final grades would be marked out of 10here most of the concepts are explained practically where as more weightage would be given on the theoretical concepts
todays society is in the era of knowledge economy all walks of life increasingly fierce competition these competition is not by the ability of individuals can win team spirit in the competition is more and more critical the personal ability is limited much work requires teamwork to complete
after that i try to finish mypart and help others
it is onlyweek 5 and i feel that i haven  t fully settled in york and my course
to cultivate hobbies do yourself with personality and at the same time read more books insist on reading will enhance your temperament increase your experience enrich your connotation and rarely have time to read books after worksometimes i am a quiet person reading a quiet person
he said that because lecture is not so important for him
i mean if i can not reasonably arrange my time to make a reasonable plan and complete the tasks according to the plan i will bear serious consequences such as not being able to finish the work in time resulting in poor quality of work
so after that i decided to use the keywords to replace the whole sentence
take notes on what you see
the all of induction programme surorised me and i love this programmeand it changed my thinking about learingi know i need improvie my experience not just knowledge
brings lots of joy and create a strong bonding among the group
however as i know in some groups there are some students who are negative in their homework like dont complete the group task
as a student we all need to prepare lessons before class
the lecture was delivered quite well all the lecturers had clear pronunciation suitable volume and detailed explanation
it is also a challengepersonally thats some of the academic issues im facing in york right now
in china during the teaching class we shouldnt interrupt our teacher for respect we can just ask the question after class
i have confidence that my understanding of engineering management would be more systematic and systemic after i graduate in the future
thereforei need to pull myself together arrange my time reasonably activelyparticipate in group discussions overcome laziness and strive for academicexcellence
more study time leads to less sleep timesuch a vicious circle
indeed the foodweather and customs of the uk are very different from those of china but iquickly adapted to it because i am learning new things with the feeling ofaccepting everything
and the body language is also required
i have not done a comprehensive timetable and i have occupied a lot of time by some unnecessary social activities and i have not carried out very good academic expansion
i think everyones similarities are that they can listen to others opinions very seriously
i really concern about what kind of knowledge i can get through this year and how to think about more creative ideas during solve problems
irrelevant question
i think i can adhere to these ethical principles whether i study this course or engage in related work in the future
in my past course nobody will tell you how to communicate and behave properly in terms of business
there are a lot of professional words in the text which rise the difficult degree when i was reading
usually in class the teacher will search some websites for us to better understand some research evidence and background knowledge
but for now i canfollow the teacher and understand the contentsfor me being a distinction grade student is always isalways a dream
for me my notes arent just a ppt copy personally i prefer to take something lecturer said or something it doesnt on the pptwhen i studied the presession course my lecturer taught me 2 different ways 1 is mind mapping 2 list
some information is hard to understandat a first glance
i think if so why we should have a collaborative learning
forming group and building up the further interdependence between members can help us a lot when facing the difficulties
in this way we can compare the merit and demerit between latest technology and traditional way which can help us know how to change our mangement way and improve the work efficiency
in short i will put team harmony firs
i think that without taking notes im more concentrated in the explanations and im trying to understand the concepts betterhowever i have always my ipad with evernote opened just in case
beside the learning and relaxing time balance are also important2library
there are more chinese members in our groupchinese team members are not very good at bringing up new ideas，sometimes we chinese sometimes only take actions according to the opinions of others without making any objectionsit means that our group may make fewer new ideas and our team idea may be not so good，or we may follow a wrong opinioni will try my best to present my own new ideas and encourage the team members to make their own opinionsbeside that i also will make some suggestions when the idea that our group take is wrong
we still meet some problems in language and we need to improve
once someone does not finish their own work the work may be difficult to complete
they are friendlywhen we played games togetherthey will encourage me when i came up with a good idea and can think other thoughtsif i think their thoughts are good we will do it togetheri think the ability to communicate and trying to understand different thoughts are essential
this is my first time having so many contact hours double lectures 2 lab sessions a day and etc
at present i still have problems in notetaking
we share ideas about the task of law because all of us were not familiar with law before we need to help each other
my previous teachers were taught in chinese but the teacher in york taught in english
these behaviours will foster success
some students finished the undergraduate courses in the ukso their english is very goodsome students was major in relevant majorso they have some professional fundationwe can learn the knowledge of undergradute course in the process of cooperation or chatting
i think they were very sincere with our questions and always answered the questions in detail
that is really a badhabit
this is my second year to study in york
at the same time the lack of communication between team members is also an important reasonbecause of the lack of communication and enthusiasm to complete the work there will inevitably be some friction between the members which will slow down the task and even some worse situations
couple of modules during the first term involved a lot of student activity which was essential for the specific module
sometimes i dont know some wordsmeaning i can guess it from the images
being familiar to the content of the lecture to make me more confident4
for therealization of the goal when we confirmed the common goal the team memberswork together to make me feel encouragedin my opinion if you want to besuccessful you should first make yourself strong and improve the team
the earliest class time in the morning is nine o clock
just worry about the credit about this course but i will try my best to do itin the fourth week i attended some career fairs and i realised that i have weakness on basic knowledge and i need to work harder than otherspersonally this question is very similarto the previous one
therefore what i expect most is that i will give an english presentation in person next week
what i mean is don  t just go and meet your meeting
instead we need a lot of reading and thinking after classin addition we have a large number of group work and team members to complete it can not only improve our understanding of knowledge but also let us make friends and improve ourselvesthe difference between undergraduate degree and master degree：1undergraduate courses focus on the teaching of engineering knowledge while graduate programs focus on the management of knowledge in the management and economic fields2in undergraduate life，more individual study and assignment，while in master life，more group tasks and case study3during college life， teachers prefer to teach knowledges while during master life teachers prefer to teach how to study4during college life i really liked to join some activities to develop my social net while now i prefer to think alone and read something at home5during college life the teachers will follow the textbooks and during the graduate life we have no textbooks only learn according to the ppti think thats all the differences between college life and master life in my opinion
i think all of the lecturer in our programme have defined what it is they were going to talk about pretty well
secondly i lack of some background knowledge such as the law and marketing so i need find more books and materials to read
after class they will review the content in the class and will feedback and summarize what they learn every weekend
also extra notes provided via vle and internal web made me think that notetaking isnt important as it was in undergraduate
this is not only the most interesting part of the group discussion but also the most difficult part to adjust
this shows that i have wasted a lot of time and lack the ability to manage timepeople often say that the harder they work the luckier they are
yes reviewing the class contents after class is important and discuss opinions with team members in timeinternational business may be not very specific and i can not understand somethings in the class so audio video is important and essential
certain tests and homework would be carried out by the teachers but things are quite different doing masters here
by splitting and assigning the work to each member separately it was good to complete the assigned work on time
sometimes they said we should have group discussion
due to that it is possible for us to improve our weakness
after the first conversation i learned that my supervisor is humorous and really want to help us with our study and life
we 7 people were divided into two small groups 4 chinese and 3 others
since we can not handle the group work by anyone self we need to trust our group members and keep attention on our own mission
well after learning this weeks law lecture about ethics i think i can work to these principles during my taught msc and in my working life as an engineering manager
i do find that i have more time than i used to because i dont waste too much of ithere are some points about the difference between the present and the previous learning experience1
besides how to make all of the groupmates have the same aim is very important
some cultures are more blunt and straight to the point but it has not been an issue thus far
in the important notes section i like to record with colouredmarkers
in addition i think i need to furtherimprove my english skills which include reading skills listening skillswriting skills and speaking skills
however we can solve this because the communication in our group is not a problem
i need to go through more ted videos after class to exercise my ability to find keywords
dont ignore the role of everyone in thegroup pay more attention to the strengths of others and be good at usingtheir strengthsaccordingto gerlach collaborative learning is based on the idea that learning isa naturally social act in which the participants talk among themselvesgerlach 1994
after that all team members should vote out a most situation solution then all of us will follow this solution and start doing our personal work
however it is difficult for me to fully and accurately understand what others are saying because of my limited english proficiency
i think if we are processing our meeting using english is more suitable
but in this year i will first worry about language problems
additionally the leader of the team can be blamed for unsuccessful
instructors also often design a lot of teamwork and compete among groups which will exercise our ability to think and teamwork in a limited time
learn toallocate and manage your time efficiently and find the right balance betweenlife and work
i am really expected that there could be more interaction like theseat the same timei hope there could be more communication with professors during our studytime if it is possible
my group mates are all nice and smart
as to bad habits to be honest i really have some bad habits such as nervous introversion procrastination
for example when i used the harvard reference in undergraduate study the university did not have such as high standard to regulate every students
the education style of this university is very good for students to evaluate knowledge by themselves
chinese universities generally assess students acceptance of courses by means of examination papers after the end of courses and before the start of holidays
yesi do
my opinion was basicallytechnical and more focus in expenses in employees and equipment therefore cashflow improved a few more
i also hope that i can help you get back to the right track when everyones ideas are unclear
however i think they can use one company in whole term for the same course
because i am afraid that i will fail so that i have to pay more attention and focus on my work and my performance to succeed
i will just decide to be on the bed not doing something tangible with my timehowever while all these are going on my intuition will be telling me you have not achieved anything for that day until i will come to the consciousness of readiness to go back to studiesit is such a funny feelings when i experience such moments
paces the paces of everything in msc is much faster than that in my first degree4
i got a friend who is in the same supervision group with me
i hope i could follow the teacher  s lectures all the time instead of constantly checking the words
in china the school library open in 630am900pm
everyone seems to have their own small group they dont want someone to join or someone to leave
additionally they rarely use the resource of the library and put most of their attention to the club and travelling
for the course of law for engineering management for msc
the lecturer sometimes spoke so quickly that i couldnt catch with him well
the mainstream way of british universities is independent thinking and teamwork
they teach in the order of technology development
so there is not too much differences between me and my team members
one is get up early in 530am which means i need sleep early at night
for example when writing a report we can give it to the team members when we are finished
when we become a graduate student we must develop our ability to find answers
to do this i dont stay up late and have a good rest in the weekdays which makes my mind clear in the next days lecture
in my undergraduate course i mainly studied theory
i do not like to take notes in class though i listen to the tutor earnestly and remember what heshe said at that time i generally forget some important viewpoints after class
we trust each other
as a result i was stressed every last 3 sunday night
not brave enough
em is a combination of engineeringtechnology and management
in addition we should to take good responsibility for our team in the future cooperation
i have overcome many difficulties in thepast two months
so i just do my best in my part and give others suggestion if they need
to get a good grade i need to overcome these bad habits and bad behaviors and i need to be more motivated and more hungry for the knowledge
yesi doi think every paper is a challengei believe i can complete the task
i have no major concerns so far
and after that i begin to take my laptop to class too
however sometimes i found that i couldnt write down my notes in time if lecturers speak too fast
i suppose that i will be very busy in this year
its glad to work with excellent teammate in that situation i explore my leadership ability which i never to notice that i can do it before
its one thing if things dont get done because other things take priority but if something doesnt get done because of an unfair excuse then thats a problem with me
when i review it i am able to find out the emphasis on the first time
but when i was in china we dont have much interaction with lecturers and all of the seminars are in the last week of the term
4 there are many students with work experience in the class
work hard to continuously improve your professional skills3
something i worried that i have some confused about my future my work
generally speaking its a little unadapted for meactually our major is full of chinese students i felt no differences between my bachelor degree and msc degree
when learning together there will naturally be a study group but such a study group is not a random combination because each students knowledge base interests learning ability mental quality are different
anyway i discussed this situation withmy supervisor we will see
and all of us are willing to open our minds to each other during the discussionwhich makes our team work efficientlymy team role of teamworker seams like that i can always accept other people idea easily and creative my opinion comprehensively
i always do my work before the deadline but our team members are really good at time management
i think the first is everyones team awareness and good attitude
in this way instead of doing a good speech i think the first thing that needs to be learned is the selfconfidence
its not a loss for myselfthe above is my own understanding of myself
compared with the undergraduate study in the uk this 2 months postgraduate course is exactly the different experience1
besides i have to be confident even if im so nervousthirdly i will take smile in my speaking and use my body language that can attract peoplealways keeping eye contact open palm asking my audience that whether they can hear me
there is also some knowledge about strategy
and the research report and essayare not the important part of study these just occupy a small part ofeducation
the bed is amazingly comfortable
during the lecturethey could scan the room make eye contact with the audience
for our lecture the most of time is teacher is speaking and we are listening
finally making decisions together with memebers
the teachers voice is loud and clear and the tone is rich
and i suppose that the supervisor meeting should be held more because that is interesting and useful
in cooperative learning i learned how toreasonably allocate tasks according to the characteristics of each membertasks must be equally distributed
they listened to our questions patiently and gave detailed answers
it really depends on the lectures
as you know international students  tuition fee is moreexpensive than native students
like what i talked about just now in previous questions
if theteam not have a good decision the chancesof the team making mistakes will be increased
i learned courses structures introductions from induction programme
shaofan also good at carding our assignmentsmost successful people are organized
firstly i think the lecturer need to have outline to the audience
when the teacher speaks outline what they say
their ethical guiding principles are quite similar to what is obtainable in the uk and as such i am bonded by such ethics of the engineering profession
i think the benefits for us is that we all have different skills that can makes the team more effective
more things should be done in the limited time and the extra time can be used for entertainment and dealing with my own affairs2
communication and good expression
and the world is always in flux as world change will generate many issues and preparing for future is needed we should take a longterm view for questions
learn something new that i havent been exposed before
but i couldnt ask questions on email
another important thing is there should be a guidance
i think they can help me have views of different perspectives and i can help them to be more realistic
we jointed all ourtalents
good things like improve communication skills and can finish some bigger projects
to be more enthusiastic and express myself more by using body language
now almost every course requires team communication and collaboration
but i believe that after taking these classes my presentation skills will be improved and i wish i wont be afraid of doing presentation in the publiceighthly the final exams almost represent the whole mark in china nearly no extra part such as presentation or collaborative learning report
its a skill that i never thought of as having to be actively learned
secondly when we have some questions about what i can not understand they use some examples and compare with a opposite point to clarify them
handouts are also used to keep everybody engaged along with exercises that are usually completed in pairs
generally speaking the professional lawyers are really professional and they would like to deliver the knowledge via their experience
the students in my class are from different countries with different culture
there are some problems in my study and daily life
wellto be honestits difficult for me to think about the situations where i might obey the ethicsas far as im concernedas a engineer or managerits important to have the social responsibilitiesif we are not careful in our work and projectsit might cause serous problems which might caught incalculable consequences
this could be a bad habit as this could be what will happen when i visit my mothers house on a regular basis
sometimes group work is more tiring than personal work because we not only have to complete the homework but also choose the time and adjust teams arrangement to assign tasks and eliminate opinionsbut collaboration is an indispensable ability in life and work in the future and we must improve our ability to collaborate
in the induction the lecturer taught many skills about how to write report and reference
furthermore my expertise is too limited i should do much more reading in the library to acquire abundant knowledge
in the team each team member finds their own role positioning andworks together for the learning goalfinallyreasonable competition and discussion
for example on the law for em all lecture courseware can be previewed on vle so it is not so difficult for us to attend the lecture because we can preview the content of the speech in advance
before taking a class with a notebook9
i believe we all chose this university for the purpose of gaining more experience
in addition if student could apply these concept the practical it will be better
lectures should look at their audience and do not only look at theirslides or floors4
unity although it is for their score unity is really important if we are in every detail about some things who did a few lines of text who did a few lines of text this is undoubtedly a terrible situationcommunicationin the discussion of some problems there may be different opinions
bme mainly investigate students abilities by examinations while em mainly by paper3
icould observe that their lectures are organized in the same way
interaction the lecturer in the msc emphasizes more on the interactions which was not common before8
the open body language would show your confidence
when i ask questions he answers with notes and examples
i wish i can solve these problems by the group work
i learned at domestic is more about calculation and drawing which is more engineering oriented
from the beginning of the autumn term to the fourth week of study life in york gradually becomes tense and full of rhythm
i prefer to discuss questions with group members but according to my observation all of the lecturer answersd the students questions seriously
10tend to let students choose the knowledge they are interested in
class mode it used to be a smallclass teaching but now it is a lecture2
they also show great respect for others idea
i think in my group that they will improve my english skill and expand my ideas
in terms of factors about hindering success first of all it is late for our class
i think this is quite consideriable because not everyone can hear the questioners question clearly
trust and promote open communication building trust is essential
in china the dormitory is four rooms
during this week i obtained many important information which can be used to help our students
surprisingly we can get feedback every week form maher and i found that every students comments given by maher is different maybe thats means the huge workload for him
but obviously there are some difficulties
the practical and challenging goals should be set work motivation should be identified to motivate the team spirit and dedication injecting inexhaustible energy to work
therefore it is difficult to evaluate them
also a summary slide is normally included at the end
i have learnt many things from collaborative learning
it means when i am paying my attention to writing down some significant points heard just now i cant absolutely make what the lecturer is speaking clear
i feel happy with the programme
for example in many cases when we constantly put forward our own ideas we also need to listen carefully to other peoples ideas and then mix these ideas to find the most suitable point
the main difference is we need more time to sit together and discuss exchanging the ideals and giving ideals
we can easily to follow the professor and there are some interesting case study
first of all language communication is the most necessary which requires members to have a common language such as english in addition to different accents to get familiar with each otheron the other hand we need a team leader who may not need to provide any practical leadership but we need such a person to lead our topic and direction in the crowd
i think the biggest reason is the classmates
i always want to write comprehensively but when i write the article the lack of materials makes me seems like less thinking
i think this is very good
yes i like challenges
noi will not go against the rae ethical prrinciples
compared to my surprise before the undergraduate course is done in the uk chinese students and feel the difference of undergraduate course in the uk and china is significant the problem of thinking and creative chinese education is still lacking i also in serious analysis about the situation how to improve my creative thinking
the study form and the teaching style are quite different from china
when i have a work that is not urgent i cant solve it in the fastesttime
different people have differentunderstanding and solutions about the same problem which seriously influencetheir working efficiency
and i also remember an interesting class that he let us to do the drama play to learn more about different personal quality of different countries
the programme about tower of york did surprise mei just together with my groupmates created the tallest tower using the a4 papers and scotch tape in limited timeat the beginning of this programmei really thought it was a critical work for our team and we did not have enough confidence to finish it on timeso we just started disscussing and sharing the ideas with each otherthan we divided the workcooperating together and built the tower step by stepfinally we made the tallest tower of yorkand we are so happy about that
but someone can use theses short period of time do something meaningful such as reading news check preparations and so on
yes through the teachers introduction to the courses this week i think it basically meets my expectationsfor example in the personal effectiveness amp masterclass i will learn much practical and useful skills like how to open personal blog how to use word and powerpoint efficientlyi believe this one year study would definitely help me learn more professional em knowledge
secondly i have a problem of procrastination
the eye contact between teachers and classmates is also very close because teachers can read a lot from the eyes of classmates
in collaborative learning students as the leading role are free to express their own views and understand the views of others
the time is different
as much as it is important to have a friendly relationship with your coworkers it is also essential for all to be professional
he said that in fact no matter what people do they are purposeful and the reason why he went to these activities is that these activities can help him accumulate more experience to get the job he wants to dowhenever and wherever we should do what we want to do we should have a firm goal and work hard
the ad contains many bad ads such as help write homework
through teamwork and continuous communication they can help me learn more about future courses
when it happened i think a good way is to do something else
different individuals have different attitudes of risk taking but i will lead my team to try something new and creative that may be adventurous
a willingness to cooperate is a must
i think getting knowledge information and changes initiative is the key to success
yes i can follow these principlesand the challenges might be1some outside temptationslike bribery 2 its a little difficult for me to keep the project confidential as i am likely to unintentionally reveal it when talking to friends
i think that based on their years of study and education experience the lecturers will choose the content that is more suitable for us to follow the development of modern technology
i feel the gap between my undergraduate and postgraduate may be a barrier for scoring my distinctionsometimes i feel overconfident which has yielded me bad results
i also find some information on the internet or take some notes from the resources adding some additional remarks to help myself understand the emphasis and give me some examples about how to use them in my homework
actually the goal can be called do best we also do it as shown
thats what i learned during this week
so i need to correct my shortcomings
and some of them are not quite good at programming i guess i can help them with codes because of my software programming background
i often use different symbol to mark different levels of significance
they tend to try and face the challenges
i will set up some meeting rules for my group as long as these are agreed by most groupmates
now i am a student of university of york i feel veryexcited and more power to study
i thought that the disputes that would arise did not appear
but everyone is still working hard to study hard
this makes me have more confidence in my future study
also all the slides are very clear i can get a lot of information from the slides
cooperative learning is conducive to giving full play to the advantages of each person so that all team members can learn from each other and improve together which is beneficial to improve the quality of learningsometimes peer help is more effective than teachers and through the interaction between students peoples enthusiasm and interest in learning can be arousedthrough this period of cooperation in team i learned a lot
but i usually could not flow the class when i was doing me notes
actually when i find there are so many chinese student in my class i am so disappointed
the most priority reason is that i really feel boring here i cant tellif it is a good or bad thing i used live in shenzheone of the most biggestcities in china
in the modules i think i can learn more study method from others by collaborative learning so i hope i can communicate with classmate to exchange ideas from each other as collaborative in some teamworks
so i need to change myself i need to take the initiative to meet new people and get more opportunities to express myself
because of thiskind of opinion i gave up setting up agenda everyday
the libraries in the university are excellent as they provide us with so many options
therefore the teamwork is not successful
they can answer our questions correctly and comprehensively and they can also give us more information about questions
this is not a good thing
critical thinking of team member
homesick will affect my physical and mental condition to some extenti really hope that i can get the distinction grade but i dont force me to get that
it is important that everyone on the team must have a positive attitude and a serious spirit
after the presectional language courses in the case of a relatively small amount of course tasks the time utilization rate of more free domination is not high and the course preparation and review are not enough and the cognitive level of theoretical knowledge is still relatively low
in addition there are also many differences in studying facilities studying environment teaching methods dietary habit dressing style communication style traffic rules and living habit
everyone  s teamwork is better than i thought
this is the main reason why i came here to study engineering managementi have lived and studied here for two months
by this way it is very useful to finish group working
only when you listen carefully and take notes carefully can you fully receive the key points from the teacher
for example the business plan i will ask every one for their suggestions and solutions
i am going to analyze about myselfin three aspects
the teaching style is quite different when i was doing bme teacher will show more details about the study content while em can help me involved in the study process
the lecture delivered very well
this is not only great for graduate study but also important for future workthe third point is the accumulation of knowledge
for example i have a lot of homework in china many architectural drawings and many exams
yes it will be my expected
to be a good student is not an easy task and excellence is not just about learning
frankly speaking these entertainment invitations are hard to refuse
because of group work you are not only responsible for your own achievements but also for the achievements of your partners
sometimes it is difficult to get rid of too much interpersonal relationships which leads to a lot of time spent on maintaining friendship and love leaving less time and space for selfimprovement
although i have been working in english before and my english level is relatively good among my classmates but i still feel it is hard for me not like using chinese freely when i was in lectures and studied the referenced materials by myself
in my opinion students shouldneed to try their best to finish their work and complete their degree
actually i am starting to doing something to improve myself on time management
the challenges i think are the conflict of interests and duties
recently i am busy with our business plan and the presentation of the water recycling system with my groupmates
because these notes were crucial and they could directly affect our assessment that is the reason why everyone should be concentrated and pay attention to tutors instead of some irrelevant issues
i am a student at dse
i usually highlight the contents that are the significance of a lecture
we need to concentrate on the assignment itself to improve our efficiency
homework  s selected was very good structured
thus in a collaborative learning setting we have the opportunityto converse with peers present and defend ideas exchange diverse beliefsquestion other conceptual frameworks and are actively engaged
as i stated before in the elog one of my goals was tostudy a master abroad
they also show us some video in the class it is really helpful when we start to learn a new knowledge
i write down things to do with the prioritizations and every time i finish one of them i will make a mark on it to improve the sense of selfmotivation
i think i can get on well with my group member
at the same time maintaining accuracy and rigor also requires a lot of concentration and confidence to complete which will become a future challenge for me as well
finally one or two of members are talking all thetime
the living environment here is totallydifferent from the environment of my first degree
absolutely
this situation happenedwhen i was working in the republic of congo
i will put them in the “ trialand error ” situation more often
he is the brother of our group
however i think it would be better if he is more flexible
during this course she wishes us to be more active and ask some questions
for instance the theories and practical knowledge
i have learned different culture people will use different ways to deal with the same problem
i used to put all the thing before deadline my group colleagues always help me to do thing follow the timetable which really help me have a better achievement of assignment than i do all the things before the deadline
it is more difficult to understand when transforming knowledge points
since our classes started i have observed that the minority of students take notes that teachers focus down during classes
in addition i am also a procrastinationpatient
environmentaldesign is mainly based on drawing but em needs to grasp certain calculations7
i think all of lectures are well organized
in the team i have been working to create new ideas and lead everyone to the right path to complete our group tasks more efficiently and quickly
i do not have some plan for me future i do not know what i can do after i finish my university life so i do not have the goal now i just finish the academic work，i think that when a person has a goal there will be motivation
i was takingnotes in each lecture
they let me have a new understanding and definition of teamwork
i thought it was an old course
1starting a project without taking risk assessment2designing a project without taking environmental friendly principle in consideration
so the thing is not how well i think my work is
1engineers mislead other people due to the lack of knowledge2engineers resign and talk some confidential information such as design
negative attitude
first of all i think the lecturer will select the relevant knowledge of this course useful books and teach us what is used for us
this story teaches me a lesson go to a meeting with your team after doing some research
onlywhen individuals are strong can they drive all development
i know the future would have lots of difficult
i didn  t read the book at home instead of watching the nba gameplaying basketball with my classmates playing online games and more
i think all lecturers speeches have been very successful
first of all joanna will be active in everyones atmosphere before the start of the class so that everyone can participate in the classroom
the necessary discussions between the groups are essential such as meeting once a week to summarise the results of the panellists and to carry out inspections and improvements together
every group member trying hisher best to make maximum contribution to thegroup
critical thinking3
tutor always speak loudly and clearly and the power point slides are clear as well and tutor always asked us some questions and have many eye to eye connect
but with the record of class in uk we can review our class efficiently and it is convenient for us to take down more notes
because i have learned that a course contains theoretical knowledge and practical guidance on the direction of engineering management which enables me to put myself into the role more quickly in the future
we are the team we need to help each others
while some get along well with others and make others feel happy
in addition teachers here attach more importance to students feedback for improving teaching quality
it would be hard to use all principles together
but we can improve ourselves when we face a tough situation
i think there are some behaviours that surprises me a lot
i am not so afraid to speak in english in front of so manypeople
even ifthere is a shortage of lecturer courses i can send an email to the appropriatelecturer to communicate
that means when teachers explain new knowledge points they can let students know what the point is to solve
group cooperative learning is a process in whichstudents exchange knowledge with each other and learn from each other
sometimes i do want to enjoy the weekend and the holiday and i choose to do some relaxed activities rather than deal with homework
i have confidence in mypersistence to find what need to be done
i think the lecture is good
of course people with similar personalities can be more easily to communicate with each other they may have the same idea or thinking modules which could finish assignment effectively
i have completed my undergraduate study at the university of york doing a bsc in music technology
i also join in a language course and learn spanish every monday so i always hope it is monday in this way i can take my spanish lessonscoolthat is all my activities and working though i am not a perfect person because i am not pound i can not be like for everyone i still insist to be better and change my demerits
one of our team members will plan forthe next meeting and make a timetable for it3
communication can help better deal with the contradictions we encounter when we encounter different perspectives
but if i lead a bad team i can also learn the skills of coordination and communication from this team
what impressed me most among these 5 weeks is the reference the lecturer used in each ppt
but their ideas are clear enough and very attractive about their lecture to be honest though almost tutors are good at the lecture sometimes i feel little boring in the law for engineering management class because there are lots of legal provisions and i cant follow the tutortutors will make a speech with a smile，and always keep eye contact with us some tutors use notes like law for emby tutors lecture i can learn some skills for make a presentation baby language voice and slides clear be confident
i was very pleased to hear that other group members said that my grouppresentations were doing very well
furthermorethere are also the group subject which i need use my imaginations to createmore that is also different compared with chinese education
we havent been working a lot in groups at least during the lectures or labs
if i do not understand ican reread the book
they seems not using it
yesthere were less team work in the past
at the same time lecturers would help us to connect two knowledge points
and i shallwill always follow the ethics
everyone should work hard for the collaborative learning and it would be a efficient way of study
sometimes lecturers had to wait 35 minutes
it is extremely important to get together for our final project
finally as professor jackson said in the lecture
i hope that the teachers explanation is more transparent
would only happen if wei do not properly understand the basis of the core elements of the course and perhaps if we do not show enough team spirit in getting our tasks done as it is expected
we must be sensitive with the otherpersons
open communication is the key5 for larger tasks assign different roles
in the law of engineering management lecture i have learned so many important laws and problems
the pace oflife here is very organized
in order to get the distinction i should do more sacrifices and make great efforts to my reportsi am trying to do my best but there are some situations which prevent me to get the distinctionfirstly as i have mentioned before the language can be the big obstacle for our foreigners
thats amazingin conclusion i do like the level of the interaction with teachers here
communication is a way of dealing with problems in teamwork
the lectures have flowed in a logical fashion with a summary of the contents given at the beginning and then each point or concept being clearly introduced one by one
really the reference and citation of information are very novelty for mymoreover i was happy when professor gave a task about the construction of castle in groups
not much to comment about the definition of the modules the lectures have so far stuck to the lecturers scope and specifications
i think lecturers delivered very well
we should make sure the audience can keep up with us and when they have questions for us we should rephrase the question to other audience and answer the question then check whether the questioner satisfied about the answer finally we should thanks themif we can pick up these presentation skills skillfully we can do better in our presentation part
sometimes the teacher will give a simple example to introduce the topic they want to talk about
there are a few situations where i could exhibit nonproductive mannerisms
each lecture is designed very well and logically
we can find the evidence of course contentssecond before the class teachers will tell us some reading list to prepare some professional knowledge and background information about next section
so that it is even harder tofind the answer
to be honest i need to apologize to professor that sometimes i always have trouble playing with my phone during class
besides i have some basic knowledge about marketing part
this really have influenced our performance the others have to work more to make sure our work can be finished
unsuccessful teamwork may have the following two factors
i believe that may lead me becomea better person
for me there is no reason to do this this are all academic misconduct
in the joannas lessons although she has the ppt she always share her handson background with us and give us some work to do
i think that sometimes collaborative learning is unsuccessful because people differ in some aspects of the work and collide and they dont come up with a solution
language learning
however many times i find that taking notes following the teachers ppt content format always makes me remember the classroom content and understand the notes
during our induction programme session we had chances to answer the questions from lecturer and we also can talk with the people who sits behind me about one topic
from working with my group on assignments i have learned that communication is the most important aspect to achieve effective results
however to give people who may be struggling a chance first and help them out is the better option
after carefully consideration they will give me some advice
i saw different versions renewed in the vle before the class
on contrary it is also have behaviors could hinder our success
theenvironment is good because now i observed that the number of students whoasked question increased
he can give advice and lead us in timehuaqing lihe is very careful and is a good performerlin wangher character is very good she is very friendly with everyone and is the teams gluemiao chenshe has her own ideas and has good executionqi chenshe has work experience a lot of ideas and the ideas found in the shortcomings are good and feasiblei want to say that let us help each other and play our own strengths in the future study and life
we were worry because cash flow wasnegative during two first years
so i always make sure my notes are up to date with the lectures and i always keep them organized so that i can refer to them during examinations
and i will try to understand others mind goal and eth value of the world
this is the experience i have learned through my recent studies and i hope i can do it well
whether it is to review the study materials or the exams it is more calm and confident and the degree of control and memory of the knowledge has been dramatically improved so taking notes is still very important
in fact there are always some questions by someone when the lectures are finished
the deliver is clear and logicyes i can hear the lecturer clearly and the slides were clear
i need to understand the knowledge in english it is really a challenge for me but i enjoy studying by a different language8
after each class there will be special time for us to ask questions
just like in themovie forrest gump the protagonist said miracles happen everyday 
working in a group is very beneficent and effective different people bring different approaches to solving the problem also new ideas it  s quicker and easier than working alone it  s inspiring
they speak not so fastnot so slow
we had not prepared for this in advance so the progress of the whole discussion was very slow
secondly we should give full play to everyones strengths and only by working together can we get twice the result with half the effort
i think in a group people need to have offertory to another people
no but it just what i expect
analysis everyones swot and allocate tasks according to it2
before the lecture our teacher will upload some relevant documents to vle which is easy for us to download in advance and make a preview before class this activity is valuable for our overseas students
it is helpful for us to organize the meeting at least once a week in which we can together solve the problems and doubts in time
therefore in the group students need not only independent thinking independent learning time and space but also to create opportunities for group cooperation and exchange so that the team members in the process of independent exploration to form their understanding of knowledge in cooperation and exchanges with people gradually improve their ideas give full play to the effectiveness of group cooperative learning4 if you can not solve the difficulty you need to ask the teacher
and time management must be a challenge
be patient with other team members
if i am a referee for a competition and one competitor is my good friend
the teaching style here is more interactive than i have experienced in the past
our classmates come from three different countries
some people continue to work when learning has clearly entered the inefficiency stage
i should make sure that the content on my slide is as simple and clear as possible
in addition body language is a very important key
a lot of my friends have told me about this behavior of mine and they have told me just speak when needed because after the time passes your words dont really matter that much
after seeing the em course introduction i think that this is an essential subject for china marketing
in the past when i was taking note i always try to record all the information i had gotten
it is sure that i will use the collaborative learning in the future
first of all when several people discuss issues together there will be disagreements
in china cars are all in the right side
i downloaded the timetable in the school website and put it in the google calendar
the time when we have the class is quiet different with my graduate life
i think its not only a big challenge but also huge motivation to me
the cases of our courses are related to the newest technology and theory in the world and lecturers will explain them carefully and give students time to consider questions2
i have seen the hofstadter cultural dimensions and lewis model in the international business lecture
in fact all of students are chinese in my group so we will not face difficult in communicationbut the most difficult challenges is the type of class and language i think that i need to contact with my tutor and classmates to avoid becoming problems
i think the form of induction is very amazing i really enjoy it
maybe some did not attend every classi think this would hinder success

but in the face of difficulties my first reaction was to escapei am also a person who has no innovation
teaching style is somehow similar from what i experienced before but i guess i am expected to work more on independent studies
i imagine that hedid not understand my question well
i think this should be contrary to your original intention
therefore when it comes to taking notes we should remember more of what we think is important as well as highlight them
for instance i likethe style of teaching of professor baruah and johana
the professional lawyers are patient enough they reserved around half an hour to answer our questions every class
this will make my life interesting but it will reduce my study time
different teaching methods the curriculum here is a combination of theory and experiment it is easier to understand what you have learned
i have heard that uk schools pay more attention on teamwork and cooperation
i also know some knowledge of employment law
finally i will draw a reasonable conclusion and set a time for questions and answers
here knowledge is more important than marks and if you have the desired knowledge then you surely will get good marks
but after he used microphone he solved this problem
learn how to understand other peoples ideas which is very important in the group discussion
what  s more we always had some group assignment after the course so we needed to make an appointment to discuss what we should do and how we did it
since the courseware can be reviewed repeatedly but the content of the class is only once it becomes more important
in collaborative learning it is important to evenly distribute tasks
however the owner of alibaba ma yun had said that the female has a good balance in the iq eq and lq love quotient so if a company want to run in a successful structure for their daily work they must have female
i totally think i can work on these principles during my masters because from my point of view they are all from common sense and they all would be they right thing to do
or after the class i could have some chance to practice that making i can use these knowledge better
finally they can draw a reasonable conclusion
during my college years almost all my classmates were my peers and most of them had the same experience
in short the team spirit is indispensable to any organisation essence
l am pleasant that l got new effective skills of notetaking
discussion mode discussion turns into an argumentbuckets effectcare too much about personal gain and loss selfishnessthese three are the fatal problems of destroying a team
and of course they were all wellprepared before they delivered lectures to us and they all use notes
when our students raise some interesting questions he always praises us and he is patient enough to answer our questions until we understand itmanagement and marketing of technology in this course noel always do the interaction with us he always raise questions for us and wish students answer the question
a persons power is small group learning isto be able to combine the strength of everyone to complete a larger task
secondly i also should review and neaten the important points in the class as soon as possible
alas
actually i think my method of taking noteis quite good
i hope that i can have more ideas and opinions as othersin the life aspect the transportation and accommodation are also very different
i tried to just write down the key points rather than the whole sentence
however now i do not have any textbook instead of many reading lists and recommended books
more examples
i have to feel nervous when i talk to others not chinese5
collaborative learning is not just about discussing issues but more importantly proposing and correcting problems in the process of collaboration
i still think the introduction programme is quite useful it help us know more about our major and meet our classmates earlier
everyone has his or her strength part and weak part some task can be finished better with the cooperation among members of the group and i can feel the support between each other i would like to study alone in the past but after this period i become more and more keen on the collaborative learning
it is hard for me to find a standard for the different teaching stylesthe teaching style which can makes me concentrate on the pace of teacher is good for me
in addition procrastination is also a big barrier for me
satisfied
i do not know
definitely it is what i expected by so far
at last
the second is a preview
the point of study is on the grade before but i think although the grade is also very important we focus more on the abilities such as presentation abilities negotiation abilities and cooperate abilities
learning to communicate with team members communication is the foundation of everything
this can work both ways for myself and the fellow student from my culture to give everyone experience
behave myself
the questions we ask are often not understanding the content of the lectures
but know i need to learn some course about the business law enterprise and personal effectiveness
i think that is not good and will make teacher unhappy
as a graduate student i have a good ability to learn independently and judge
so i work out some solutions to solve the problem first i think its very important to focus on the lecture itself
thisare some positive things that i could extract from my lecturersjhonissitt is the level of high voice and humor in his presentationnoeljackson is his presentation clothes and his slides because they are highly goodstructured and slides and they have some amazing way to appearprofessorbaruad is body language
actually im always afraid to say something to the public but im wrong i need to say it
the speech worked well
i think the most important thing for cooperative learning is to be selfconscious and responsible
the members should plan to complete the assigned task within the projected time
so maybe i need atimetable in order to make all things organized
yes the teaching style here is a lot different than what i experienced in my past
the lewis model multiactive linearactive reactivedifferent conversation stylesthe process of trial
at present i am the leader of our group because in the enterprise course i chose to act as the ceo
for the courses i use list skillwell this is my firsttime study in the whole english lessons this is a massive challenge
as some topic of the lecture is very serious and academic the audience might feel boring or sleepy for the presentation
leadership of leader is important too
many student like it
he didnot use slides
at the same time he always use many different ways to let students learn theory through practice and strengthen their memories
combining theory with practical applications better
bidyaut baruah in case of bidyaut the flow of lecture is always amazing in case of marketing of technology and also in enterprisein enterprise with the slides of bidyaut it really helped us to move from one point to another specially during the case of finance sourcing and during the making of marketing strategieshe answered our questions very effectively so things would be clear towards usnoel jackson in case of noel his lecture of enterprise helped us in getting ready our business idea and also it reminded us that now we have to make idea and move on with different aspects of business ideahis way of answering questions is really nicealways try to clear things towards studentsjohn issitt he is really good in explaining things although his slides are simple on micro soft word but the amazing thing is he engaged students with him during the whole lecture with different activities
my previous professional direction was mainly to be a programmer can be programmed with different code
i never contact with the business and management lectures before so that is a big challenge and it is interesting
the advantage of collaborative learning is to bring together everyones power finally to compete a huge work
if lecturer organize their ppt carefully and seriously and using brilliant illustrations people can focus more on the presentation
i think the biggest factor preventing me from becoming agood student is that no selfcontrol
i think it is pretty good and i should learn to them
perhaps it is another efficient way to solve out problems and solutions
in my bachelor degree students dont need to read too much out from textbook while in york there are no textbook students need to read recommended books4 accommodation
one day it collapsed without any omen and there were several cars being drived on it so these people in vehicles dropt in sea and lost their lifethis is the typical situtation which violate the rae ethical principles
confidence
therefore it is not good at completing the tasks of each course
at that time i took learning and improving myself as the goal of that period of life
we all should have the clear aim tocomplete assignment
i gain a lot from collaborative learning as i have learned a lot of things from my peers in the group
what are the main differences you have observed that have affected your teams work
it can really help us to get a logical presentation and i think this logic could be easy for the lecturer to remember and easy for audience to understand
and i also learned the lewis  s model as well as maslow  s hierarchy of need
so far there isnt
misunderstandings may arise in communication
never delay anything4
yesduring the inductioni know something about this majorit involves multiple aspectsso it  s not boring and i will gain more knowledge
yesit is different from the class that i have attended and i am happy with the induction programwhich helped me to know more about my major
so in the view of the whole structure is very clearas for each lecture teachers use kinds of ways to attract us engage with the classes like communication joke eye contact body language
group members should pay attention to each other look at each other with their eyes communicate with each other with their eyes and think about the content of the speech at the same time
but it is difficult to measure whether it is better than the disadvantage
the best thing is that all the lecturers are good at using eye contact to make sure everyone in the class can engage in lecture
during challenging scenarios i have always looked for guidance from my superiors
therefore i need to stop the ineffective efforts
and the content of presentation are all related to the topic and every point have enough evidence to support which is the most worth for me to learn
already know the british teaching style
however some words are hard to rememberi need to look them up again in classi will write down the new words in my notebookthere are some models and some theorems involved in some courses but the teacher will not conduct detailed analysis and examplesi will draw a small star in other colors to express my interest and read more articles after classusually these models involve proper nouns and these models can related to other modelsi will leave a blank around this knowledge point to supplement my knowledge
i always have a plan but i am not very careful
although i know i should finish my homework first i am not in a hurry to do my homework until the deadline
if i stick to run on the urban green way i canachieve the same effect as the sport center and use the saved money to do moremeaningful things
i hope i can be more active in the class
for other classes the teachers teaching effect plays a crucial role in students understanding of knowledge points
if we want the collaborative learning be successful all members of the group should finish their own tasks well
and i always have a notebook with me in every class because in the lecture the teacher will say something that the slides do not so the notes are very important
i think most of the time i think our lectures flow logicallyand some teachers use some humour which can really attract my attention
because most of people are not a native speck using english
it is not easy for us to complete both the study of theoretical knowledge and the accumulation of project practice experience
i thought the purpose of the activity was just to tell students about whats on the coursein fact teachers also spread positive energy to us and encouraged us
the premise of selfconfidence is to be fully prepared which means that what i need to learn is how to enrich myself and how to get enough knowledge
i believe you can image the preparation qualityto avoid this situation happen again i do the changes since week 5
i think so but it is hard to say at this point
strategic management of engineering management range accuracy
regular discussions can not only monitor the work of team members but also raise questions for discussion and solution which is conducive to the development of the team
actually i am quite worried about this bad habit while i can not control myself to be concentrated on one thing especially study for long time
i think that how to balance the cost of capital and quality of products is key and diffcult to manage projects
first as i have answered above the timing is unreasonable and there is not enough time to access the information and thinking
as a programmer i dont really need too much teamwork
assignment amount i have much more assignments to do in the msc than that in my first degree3
term 1 end of week 9 log entry self promotion and personal reflectionexercise on self marketing and promotionthis weeks personal effectiveness and masterclass workshop is about selfmarketing and promotion using social media
then i set a flag that i must complete all items in the plan but it seems that the bad cycle of procrastination never be broken
his slides are clear
i think the best thing i need to learn from lecturers is confidence
it is difficultto understand or ask good questions
for some bad behaviours like being absent from class and copying others assignments these will hinder success
because of the course i have majored during my undergraduate period i have some experience about this course
everyone in the group has their own opinions and is unwilling to be accommodating
the method of collaborative learning can also be updatedfor example our group can also cooperate with other groups and learn more from each other
and usually i have two colors of pens one takes notes the other makes marks it shows me the importance of notes i have taken
i will also try my best to help my groupmates
i should learn to be confident and learn to control my nervousness
it can be a good lesson even if you failed
i can compare the different regulation between different counties which is really attractive for meso i think i should be more passionate than before
in britain teachers like to use email as the main communication while in china they usually use telephone or wechat to communicate7
the amount of knowledge to learn the range of knowledge learned before is relatively simple but now the range of knowledge learned is relatively wide4
this is my first experience studying in york
strict teaching style can push my study but i will be afraid of the teacher afraid that i will be criticized by the teacher if i am wrong so i dare not put forward my own opinions and i dare not question the teacher on some issues
and repeat key words to do forward layer upon layerhumor can be employed in appropriate time not too muchlecturers have to guide audiences to watch and think from one point to the nextand the lecturer has done it skillfully
firstly ireviewed all the cash flow with weifan and yifan
i feel satisfied when we finished a group task
everyday should to be planed
most students are still quite apprehensive to talk during lectures and group meetings
they givedifferent point of view
sharing knowledge and work for a better result together are everyones duties
i think the all the activities help us a lothowever the deparment need to add some activities like participation in sport events because most people like sport for example soccer
when working in a group we should consider not only our own factors but also the situations of others such as the personal abilities advantages and time arrangement of team members
yesi think it will be
the university of york also offers a lot of activities for me to choose7i am a person who does not have time management
because modest people will receive respect from others
but i think sometimes we spent too much time on the discussion and we talked about something unrelated to the assignment too
i have noticed the powerpoint slides can be very important in that case i will use suitable easy and appropriate colour instead of complicated colour to make the whole powerpoint looks clearly and logically
they communicate mostly in their native or country languagei had expected i will be in a class where everyone will relate freely with each other and share ideas and knowledge on topical issues of common interest and most importantly learn from each others attributes
so i have many opportunities to contact with the local people and with the local business also have many opportunities for communication in general i have gained a good learning experience and internship experiencethe graduate major i studied before was msc information technology
as a result theymay feel anxious and pain when they read a lot of books because they cannotknow how to study in an efficient way and finish tasks easily
as we all know we can learn more from others especially when they from different countries
whether they are active in thinking or very willing to listen to other peoples ideas they have let me grow and learn in this group and let my graduate life adds a lot of funthirdly i have to say that during the life in uk which brings me a lot of change
here i have to take the initiative to go to the library to access the information and find useful information8
i think the biggest challenge is the relationship in my group because when we have some works to do if member can not work together and just do own thing without communication which should be the problem in teamwork
next i would like to compare the difference between my bachelors degree education from china and my masters degree education from york university1 teaching materialin china textbooks are included in the tuition fee and many books are distributed every semester
maybe each one has almost the same knowledge and when do collaborative learning they cant get more knowledge2
unfortunately i missed the flightthe worse thing is that the afterward flight to the city was cancelled because of the bad weatherso i couldnt take part in the seminari felt very sorry to my tutoras i didnt live up to his trusti felt sorry to my classmatesince i leave her alonei guess i should have said sorry to the taxi driveri really shouldnt have yelled at himafter this experience i did selfreflectionfirstlyi should learn how to manage time well and make a plan in advance
they always give us the overview and object of this course and teach us to step by step
everyone has their own timetable it is hard to get together to discuss some questions
i am satisfied with this programme so far
everyone should target the same goal and take efforts
also iwrite some essays to practice my academic writing and critical thinking
however on the other hand there are some people who are skipping some lessons saying that isnt my interest or i have better things to do
i t seems to be similar to my undergraduate course lecturelab balance
and i do like his class because of the teaching style of him
his class is wonderful not only because of his logic but also because his voice is very clear and easy to understandtw teaches us law probably because i have not studied law in my undergraduate course so sometimes i am confused when i go to class
i dont think the longer the group discussion is the better
i have experiences as an exchange student before so i do not think i use much time to get used to studying here
i think some of them have many ideas and they can speak english fluentlyhowever i thick i lack creativity skilli can improve this skill and i can also improve my spoken englishi think communication with each other is essential for successful collaborative learning
i think that will make the situation worse cause thesituation will become like that some of members discuss the right topic andother members discuss the wrong one they keep discussing on different channelsand that make my learning efficiency lower
moreover reading is entirely selfconscious and the content of reading may or may not be relevant to the class because the textbook contains the information required by the course
here are three reasons why chinese students present are less active in the classroom than foreign students
this required me to to understand and use the knowledge and skills required as an engineering student to design construct and test the digital multimeter over the course of two terms
like professorbarua she also asks saying could you hear me
so in the future i will organize the time more scientifically and efficiently4
on the other hand i am always not confident enough
but i pay more attention to travel and development of my new habits
i have seen a few students who have been really kind and generous towards others but on the flip side there are a few who i thought were not willing to get out of their comfort zone
always have additionaldiscussions with classmates in class
arranging a group meeting regularly like at least once a week and once we have problems we can discuss and solve them in the first place
i didnt have a job which is why i was younger than most of my classmates
because i think that the amount of knowledge that can be obtained in class is very small we must learn and develop the skills of independent learning
everyone has different work experience and educational background and they may deal with the problem in different ways
i dont know waht are afternoon sessions and activities
different tutors have different english accents so i have to practice my listening skillin addition i find some useful study resources egexample of exam sheetslecture notes and pptin module websitei think i should work hardtry my best to achieve a balance between entertainmentin library and study
every one have own idea some idea is different from others
sorry i get no evidence of research or background knowledge about that it is just from the personally experience in lecture or in individual presentation
secondly it will also helpful during my professional life if i work in any company then i have to work within a team of people so it might be helpful for me during working with people of different cultures and behaviors
especially in this stage of skill learning it may be that they are confused about the knowledge points they dont understand so everyone will spend more time asking
if i have difficulties in my studies i can ask for their help
in team work the member responsible for verification and proofreading is never me
because what i do is not follow the ethics that means what i do 99 is harmful to our society
same destination is our direction and we have a nice time after a serious of course worksecondly i learnt how to pay more attention to others advantages and ignore disadvantages in this way we could have a great improve during a strange area
although its incredible to meet the situation that i can not solve the problems i normally ask help from internet and my classmates with a positive attitude
i am a lazy person so i will have delays in my homework and assignments after class
environmental design does notneed this capability
the first two weeks i have just arrived here are days that i will never forget in my life
when the first time we were asked to make a plan to sell something we decided what we gon na sell and the function of products i was surprised by our imagination i never thought that we really can make a programme to sell a pillow and in the last we won the prize
but in these weeks most of the students are sitting in front of the classroom if you want to sit top three rows in the room you have to arrive to the classroom early
recently i was research some background information for the international business presentationi need to choose an international company to be an example
like the wellknown website youtube there are many ads in it
when i write some notes i often highlight some important knowledge and this method can help me easily recognise and see it
there are also many benefits from working in groups such as pooling together everybodys knowledge and skills to get certain tasks done and to assign roles effectively to match each team members strengths
i just got to know my groupmates very fast
i think it is a very useful strategy
report exams and report6
secondly the teachers body language is very good making it easy for people to keep up with his rhythm
i think graduating is more difficult than in china
sorry about that
as for long term orientation i learned that we can not focus on immediate interests but ignore the longterm development which may let us fail at everythingso i need to plan for the long term in both study and work as well as improve the ability of time management
usually in the colleges in china we do not need to read a long list of resources
we can get to some professional lawyers during this course
every company employee should learn that howto get the most out of the minimum consumption and teamwork will greatlyimprove the efficiency of this processfinally collaborative learning can alsotrain some positive relationships
as a result the content of the whole classis only halfunderstood and you must spend a lot of time on the review after classlecturers will assign some articles for us about next lecture to read so that itcan help us understand professional background knowledge expand our knowledgeinspired us to ask questions trigger thought and question authority helps toimprove our critical thinking which helps us to write academic papers after whichthere are a lot of ideas and arguments can refer to
when i was showing my presentation i was very nervous because i did not do a lot of exercises and preparations
the classmates here are more engaged in the courses and lectures not just the listener
i think the scope and specification of the lectures are based on what they think is important knowledge for example：the course of bb he taught the definition of marketing development history marketing model strategy and other important knowledge in the scope
there is no detailed content on the slides
i hope my classmates can be more active
but i think the uks teaching and studying style fit me well and i have adapted to it easily after two months adaptation
team workin china i only had a lab partnerherelots of homework need team work9
i am adapting these newways of learning
thats quite helpful for our future careermost importantly for the final exam we just get the final mark in china but in the university of york we can get the practical comments which definitely help me a lot in futures improvement
in my group when we discuss some question different person always can gives different kind of thinking about the answer
to be honest i do meet some problems or challenges in the progress of group work
he did notuse notes in his presentationjoanna north i heard her clearly because she spoke loudly
in the next year i think we would have a lot of group works
sometimesit may be hard for audiences to understand complex or professional words usingthe body language can help them handle this problemthird
time flies the first term of studying at the university of york is close to the end
and pratice pratice and pratice
the evidence of research or background knowledge of subject can be seen in the reference slide including some books and websites
now i have the confident that i can study well in the future because there are many konwledge i familiar with
to avoid and change these bad habits which connected to the time management i started to use my cellphone to make time counting
secondly i seldom read the notes on the computer so it is no doubt that i can not achieve the meaning of taking notes
she always answers the question with some possible solutions
discussion
apart from learning and traveling time i am basically playinggames which includes xbox playstation and computer
in my opinion some of our lecturers spoke very clearly in class
i like this way of learning
however to be honest i am not so aspiring to be a distinction grade student
yes i feel that i made a good choice and the msc in em is so good that much more than what i expected
how do you view and learn materials
every thing should be considered as a group problem
once time the lecturer asked the students to discuss a topic withtheir partners and then he will ask a classmate to express their views
however after class they rarely urge us to learn
at the same time i will prepar a large number of academic articles were cited as research evidence in the slides
and it is such a difficult lecture because there are so many professional vocabularies that i cant understand
for example i did some preparing work for the comingclass
in studying aspect i gradually get used to the fast teaching and learning style here although it is quite different from what i accepted before
i feel that these inductions are very useful
that is to say when those things happened not only my time but also other people  s time are wasted
now my style of lectures are in large class there are lots of students but in my degree i always studied with 20 or 30 students8
because they are all very very very knowledgeable and all the content in their brainthat is so cool and i hope i can gat their level in a day
the last but not least there is no clear division of labor in teamwork in this situation it might be easily lead to duplication or omission of work
i have been able to understand my notes when i have reviewed them thus far
when i feel hungry i will go the kitchen and spend hours to cooksome food for myself while i may only take some biscuits to fill myself if i studyin the library and that won  t cost me so much time
besides i was also addicted to computer games
i think that treating academics is just like being a human being
i think the activity that a group built a paper tower to hold an orange was most helpful because it made us have a better understanding of the importance and meaning of team work
in addition to that people may appear to be annoying or seem not to be taking things seriously
secondly i will use those small items to help mr feel more productive
finally bothcomplemented very wellfinally a white board or screen where each member cansee where his or her ideas could fit better
my notes are always very straightforward easy clear and in order – i never had a problem with understanding my notes
and i usually review my notes with watching ppt that the lecturers upload on the vle
because we are going to get along with each other for the whole year
actually i didnt ask any questions during the lectures
in the middle i mainly record the key content heard in the class and the left side summarizes the content of the class
first of all collaborative learning make us studying efficiently because a task could be divided into several small parts and finished by each person
actually every group would face unsuccessful project but it is not important
during this twomonth period i not only learned the new knowledge but also made mew friends
also this activity helps us to know each other easily
more essay to write on4
in the process of learning in the future i hope that i can be more patient and face teamwork and learn how to face differences in the face of cultural differences
no i dont think so i was in that condition before because as an engineer i came here for my masters course so i should need to abide all rules which engineer need to follow according to raewe are engineering management students so we need to use wisely understandingsknowledge and skillswe always need to learn that as an engineer we have to keep our knowledge up to date and we should need to move with technology progress
only by keeping yourself in a good working condition can you make what you want to do
building tower was very helpful because it needed creativity cooperation and practice
this is a good way for me not to be limited in a theoryin addition the course content assignment content class environment learning pressure and classmates are also very different from my first degree
cause the audience won  t read them if there are too many wordsfifth
the lecturer occasionally refocuses our attention with humor and humorous examples or makes it easy for us to remember the knowledge points
such as this elearning log in the first and second week i can start to write it in friday
and it can help us clearly know whether we really learned or understood the knowledge lectures had shown in class through the presentations
some times we really need to balance the mind from teammates and avoid useless debates
make notes on where you think the challenges are likely to be
i attended a course ten years ago in the university also i saw a few topics of the course in my job
it really can be called the dilemma
manage it addressing the root cause to avoid it grow bigger
it can help me to improve my vision
at the same time i will meet the ethical standards of chinese engineers and set a standard for myself more strictly
therefore it has little to do with the teachers presentation but bidyut has done an outstanding job
occasionally there will be some small games during class such as drama performances etc
to be entirely fair i did my first degree here as well so i cant say that theres much of a transition period at all
all of my actions are conform the rae ethical principles
from my point of view the lecturers are conscious of what they are talking about and know about the topics a lot so if at any case the students make a question they are able to answer and provide the best information even offering extra work
they are brave enough to say their thoughts i hope that i can have enough courage to do so
ive observed these behaviours but i cant remember who did these
they always work hard and remind me to do so
noel ：the way of lecturing is like an experienced old man who is more willing to ask us our opinions on some questions in class
i have folders for each module in my notebook and i label each lecture at the beginning so i have all notes for assignments
because the undergraduate study content is mainly physics the previous study is based on selflearning
what didyou expect
teachers will tell us a lot of knowledge in a short time and we need more time to digest this knowledge
i have found myself many times in funny situation where i will be showing lackadaisical attitudes towards my studies
besides i can solve the conflicts among the teamwork
good body language will bring people closer to each other and make the speaker look easierbe very familiar with what you are talking about
the fourth week virtually all the studentsare already familiar with but just the course for project management
i sometimes have no ability to say “ no ” with my friends
learning this course just learning the contents in the slides is not enough the most important thing is to know how to solve the questions
after a fiveweek study i can feel that every lecturer has their own style and their lectures designed are really different
another example of bad habits would be the habit of not speaking when needed
some students tend to take many notes where other will take very few however this is not surprising as i understand that individual student benefit from different methods of engagement with the lectures
i think the teachers answer our questions quite wellas for other students questions most of the teachers repeat the questions which may be quite useful
of view accurately to make it clear for others and balancing the abilities of different people in the team
and this kind of teaching style is really helpful for our study and i adapt to this teaching style quickly
but the emotion quality is more important than professional quality sometimes because a person who always be offensive and selfish can never be welcomed wherever she is
the classmates and friends around you are now accepting different cultures
it is totally surprised me that it is such a funny subject and i will use the way of learning taught my the professor
as we know our subject focus on management but my major is civil engineering before
in addition to accept the more advanced education our purpose of studying is to learn different people different cultures and open up a broader vision for ourselves
we have not done much group work in our modules so far this year but generally i learn more things due to other peoples different approaches to a given subject as they might notice something that i would not and i hope the same is true of the reverse case
and the library and research techniques were introduced carefully with the practice so i can use the library resourses by using the website nowbesides for helping us in learning the previous students tell the experiences to us and we have divided the supervision group for just six students which means the tutor can help us directly and convenintly
well its quite different compared with what i have experienced before
the machine needs maintenance and people need entertainment
refuse to accept others advice insist own opinions without communication and compromise
this method does help me a lot
presentationis a very interesting project
as a result this habit of not taking notes made me have a lot of problems in my study
i think that the most important factor in group cooperation is to learn the advantages of others
learn how to manage how to work together how to improve efficiency how to become a qualified manager
because of the lack of a capable person to lead all team members to carry out group work
however like me personally i think that what i lack most is selfmanagement skills especially in terms of time management
talking about how am i show levels of significance in my notes i think mark pen is handy
the past inductions are match my imagine
my turn was just in the middle
however i found that there are less connections between the things written which means it is difficult to connect them when i reviewing
in particular i am very happy with a lot of practical content in courses
they are all diligent and full of responsibility
it was not until the before two days of the deadline that preparations began
i recognize that i like to talk a more in some meetings
they often list the defects of the previous technology and then tell us what problems the new technology solves
such a trust worthy person makes you fellat ease when you give the person a work
civil engineering has less essays and the word account is always not over 2000 words but now the word account even over 6000 words
finally i will try to think something in my team members angle when we have conflict
if one group member decides not to contribute the work would have to be picked up by other group members when they already have tasks to deal with
each person expresses his or herideas and others analyzed and asked question about the topic
for example if i mark triangle under a sentence it means that this knowledge is quite important
third in the process of group work we should alwaysstand others perspective to think about questions and build close relationshipswith colleagues
because there may be some sentences that can not be understood in the class but as long as you read the courseware in advance you can go to the lecture with questions which can help you have a deeper understanding of the content presented in the classthe second is time
the other is try to finish every things in the google calendar plan except some emergencies
each of us has joined different groups and achieved the same goal which really increases our ability to work as a team especially in the field of handson practice
of course i am not a distinction grade student until now because i have many defects
the students in my class are mostly reserved especially the chinese studentsin fact what surprises me is that they speak in chinese language all the time
the way to preview is to look at the textbook and try to do the exercises by ourselves3knowledgein york my courses include international business enterprise marketing and so on
so for this i dont really have a way to do it better
lecturers help me a lot move from one point to the next
it is one of my purpose to come to england
yes through this weeks introductory course i think the study here is very focused on teamwork which is very different from my past learning experience i am very much looking forward to this way
this is a good thing as in the work place one may be expected to be capable of working in a team with professionals who come from different countries and to be able to focus on an end goal and work efficiently as a team
studying engineering management course needs to have a lot of reading9the theory of engineering management may be used differently in different countries while the theory of physics is invariable10
sometimesit fails because there is a lack of a leader who is strongmind
because i like the challenge
i have understood what he was talkingduring the class
whats more the size of the text is also a way to distinguish the levels of significance
and there were some interactions between the lecturer and the students when lecturers defined the terms which did impress us a lot so that we wouldnt forget it easily
but we can solve it in time
in china teachers teach more on the basis of an existing textbook2the way of homework is different
an example of this would be the academic writing aspect of the pdf showing how important it is to reference accurately
yes
and we will do the case study and case analysis in the future to use the knowledge we have learned into practice
when the opportunity comes we can not miss the opportunity and will not be sad because we dont get the chance
i think it may be related to the different teaching style
for the course of management of technology the lecturer is mr jackson noel
it is not so easy for me to make a great work schedule
actually i suppose that it will be less useful to take notes in class
another fatal flaw of mine is that i am a bit of a playful person
to be honest i really want to get the distinction and i have planned to get the distinction since i get the offer from our university
because only under the guidance of such an attitude the team can work hard together3
i asked him why he had to participate in many activities that didnt seem to be of much use
only in this way can this group can be successful
in china teachers will tell you the focus of some problems8
for example donnot listen carefully in the class and always focus on their mobile phone
it can not be avoided or delayed and must be given priority
therefore i believe that we can help each other very well
everyone can play to their strengths in the group
moreover professors are very sensible to audience
because of the clear notes i can understand the reading and the lecture much more easier
those readings are the first choice for me to find some evidence or background knowledge of my topic
in britain there are many students from other countries and regions。2there are a lot of things that need to be previewed before class
i think its a wonderful opportunity to have something difficult to settle in a group in the university course through which we can learn a lot
the afternoon session helped me familiar with the university
at the same time i also hope thati can get rid of my bad behaviour in learning
i think i canthe most challenges is how to protect environmentbecause most of human activities cause pollution to the environment
they are familiar with knowledge so i dont see anyone using notes
i should practice more to get over the scary and become more confident graduallylast but not least i should pay more attention on reading
on this basis it is also very important to ensure the high efficiency of learning
this is not a question that can be answered in one sentence
the induction programme surprised me because it introduced the structure of em which is quite different from the structure of my previous major
i want to add more tutorials
in china the government will set the target to achieve in the future five years and a decade year we all prefer making the aim of our work but poor in plan thing for personnel that may due to the education what we are accepted
students in my class are very actiive and they always come up with many innovative solutions
in the university of york the first day we meet the classmates we have a supervision team which need to cooperate with each other in the next 1 year7communication
but as time went by with the help of my teachers and classmates i slowly adapted to this life and studying environment
however there is too much content in the course and there will be some new words and professional nouns
it helps me develop the ability of critical thinking and indepth analysis 3
i believe that we all have common interests and an enthusiasm for the subject
i think we should discuss the project more slowly and carefully
certain students can be a bit quiet though im not sure that would hinder success as theyre still enthusiastic and gladly contribute when asked
the first thing i learnt is using google calendar
a persons ability is limited for example a teacher to dozens of students in the general manager will inevitably appear loopholes or there is no place to check
i think the logical order of the lecturers is easy for me to accept
in the group meeting the three team members actively shareda lot of valuable knowledge much of which came from the books they had read inthe library the day before
civil engineering lecture has a lot of british people but now there are a lot of chinese people4
its not very good for me but its important so i push myself every day to make learning my own business
it plays negatively because the other person can not have the opportunityto talk or say something about the topic
secondly to explain the points
some of them play rock music and others play sports
i believe that if i solve these problems i will be closer and closer to a distinction grade student
most of things are included in the powerpoint of the lecture therefore actually there are not many things we need to taking a note
good at listening to others opinionscooperation with othersgiving the feedback to your team memberswilling share ideas with each others
individual work and team work division of main difference lies in how to deal with and the potential problems personal work is tend to ignore the potential problems only when it is encountered in dealing with problems but work as a team we cant make everyone along with the process of the team at any time change this will increase the difficulty that work so we need to potential problems and the analysis of the main route to come out and then step by step test and analysis
almost
therefore the divergence of thoughts is a very common and normal phenomenon
i think sometimes engineering conditions are so complicated that you may have to break some rules
due to a large number of internationalstudents from different countries i can learn about their different culturalbackground and explore some hot topics
i think absence should be avoided
the content of the induction programme is very rich which gives me a deeper understanding of the department
the key to making a successful class note is to develop my own shorthand system
i felt comfortable with the pace of the lecture
besides i have to strength my confidence and answer questions loudly when i am on class
of course i am very resistant to this lazy behavior
however this can be averted by investing more time in self study to ensure as individuals each team member is well rooted in the core elements of the course
i am not sure that i can work to these principles during your taught msc and in your working life as an engineering manager
most of my notes are clear for me so i can review it easily
but i hope that i can succeed through continuous efforts
duringthe two months in york i enjoy the process of studying here very much and feellucky to be here
during studying at university of york for two months i think it is quite different between my learning experience before and the msc in em
with the knowledge that lecture capture preserves the lectures for students to watch at their leisure helps dramatically when it comes to finding key information
from collaborative learning in enterprise assignment
i was a little surprised that students and lectures are being very informalin korean standard
yes even though there were some sessions like the resilience one that i didnt know we were going to have it but i really like all
wow… i studied optic electronic commercial law was a totally different subject
lecturers are very confidence when they give others presentation
i will try my best to get accustomed to the new style
less complex mathematics calculation
because similar team members can supervise and improve each other and dissimilar members can make up for each others missing places thus improving the teams work efficiency
in terms of teaching i can feelthat the instructor tries to let us understand the abstract concept in a moreinteresting waythe main difference between your firstdegree and yorks em masters degree is1
as a graduate student the teacher gave us a lot of time for selfstudy
everyone should be responsible to our group work and the result whether they are good or not10
so they have different attitudes to one thing
at the same time learn to listen and understand partners
if you do not mobilise the enthusiasm of all the team members then the groups homework will fail the same will lead to contradictions within the group4 lack of group management
at this time it is very important for the speaker to attract the attention of the audience so some lecturers will use their humor
i hope that i can do the work of an executor in the group
apart from the course content being completely different i still find myself borrowing techniques from my undergraduate course in terms of learning
they are quick and often very easy
this is not a good habit because it not only push him to high risk of miss the due time but also easily miss opportunities
and when we have group assignments and discussions their ideas and presentation surprise me i like it and this can help me promote my ability
bidyut baruah responded good my questionsjoanna north responded good my questions too
i was an ipc student last year and i have write many papers but i still do not satisified with my sriting abilitym i think i still need to work hard in the next months
i believe this is very effective
thus a group of people can make up each others shortcoming and show their advantages
the slides made by her is concise enough there wont be so much slides for her course
activities with my group of supervision were surprised me because i thought the induction programme is only introduction about department
lecturers who teach in large classrooms usually wear speakers so that every student can hear them
its very clear and unforgettableas for the marketing and managing of technology lectures it is separated into two parts marketing and management and these two lecturers have totally different teaching style
and finally some interesting questions could be set for audience
i have chatted with a friend on campus
the characters and personalities of groupmates are also different and it may make communication not as smoothly as expected4
communication with each other talk about what you thought especially talk about someone bad this is hard to say
now we are not very familiar i think i need time to understand them but only now we are an excellent teamin the shocking group activities irealized the strength of our group and also the different personalities of thegroup members
several important points in the speech the first must let the audience know the theme of the speech at the beginning
and for that purpose i apply at least two consecutiveyears to universities in europe
i need to arrange my time next term because every time is so limited i need to prepare my assginment early3
sometimes i feel that my ability that looking up information needs to be improved
if they still dont make changes only failure will wait for them
i think it is just a waste of time
these changes more or less have an impact on individuals
during class i would like to take notes down about the focus points that the lecturers said
take a computer class here
however there are lecturers that i have no prior experience with and from what i observed could have a different teaching style
language difference
their creative thinking can help me to think in an innovative way
only a moment of communication and collaborative learning can achieve the desired results
these are behavioursthat i feel it will foster successalejandro is a good student
last but not least the body language and facial expression are another essential acting to attract students and scratch the attention from us
in this way the organizational structure tasks and efficiency can be clearly defined
they speak english very well and they are willing to express themselves although we are not familiar nowi think they might improve my expression ability by chatting with themand i would respect their opinions in any situationcommunication is the key in a groupi think
it is best to accept the opinions of others in a humble manner which will make you betterat the same time we must also put forward opinions on others which will make you progress together
i dont think of some activities that are suitable for adding but i think the communication time between the supervisor and the classmates should be longer which makes it easier to understand each others background and some learning or life concerns
then i would start thinking about other areas such as ball games computer games outdoor activities parties and other exterior attractive things this caused i always ignored some important knowledge and theory at class
but the other countries student are more likely to answer the question
it not only helped us to think widely but also taught us to manage our time when we need to complete a program
it was alittle difficult to follow because i could not hear very well
in chinayou will not know your teacher will talk about in next session
then we pick the best solution to perform the team task
i likeour lecturers teams
i will believe in the team
because i think it is really hard to find the references
the way of doing the work is different
i believe all the above are essential to have a successful presentation and these can help deliver theoretical and complicated information in a more relaxed yet serious environment
i think that induction was ok a good start point
i can easily caught the main information in the powerpoint
yesi didn  t think we have the activities that need us to draw a picture or make a paper toweryesi enjoyed these activities and know more detail information about emyesi need to think more and image moreand i need to produce more ideas as many as possible and choose what i think is best
under the premise of respecting others we can get along with eachother and as a result the efficiency of teamwork is greatly improvednext the division of labour is cleargenerally speaking in a group of 5 people a leader is needed to develop aplan and other team members go to perform
i had different opinions but i usually followed the advice of most people and did not make additional proposals
i will try my best to work to these principles
improve classroom communication and feedback with teachers
everyone can question freely so that we can notice the problem timely7
i have traveled a lot in my country but this is the first time that i have been so independent
it is kindof funny but i respect him for that
i think this is the key to success
i take a very serious attitude towards academic work and i can do my best to make every job and every task
when i encounter a learning problem i can  t handle very well iwill seek help from my group members
conjunctions can not be used very frequently because it will make your presentation unnatural the words used in presentation can be verbal rather than too formalthe accent is better avoided in the presentation
i have sent the email to her about some worries of my future career and she has given me some advice
in normal classes lecturers often use hand movements to help us understand what they are trying to say while also allowing us to focus on the content of the lecture
i need to acknowledge that this isvery remarkable point
well i think a good communication can help you to success we have to learn how to do a efficient communication with your group and your classmates it can save more time for everyonebesides share your idea is also very important everyone can learn the new things from each otherwhich help us to improve and perfectas for the behaviours which might hinder success the first point come to my mind is too shy to ask the questions
i have been in york for two months
because of different educational environment the levels of awareness of academic misconduct is different
now im getting used to the university of york of learning environment
due to mylimited vocabulary i could not fully understand a small part of the lecturealthough the lecturer had a detailed discussion i still needed more practiceafter classfor otherfactors i will discuss one by onelisteningmost of the classroom is huge like amphitheatre but each lecturer teachingusing the microphone
i really concerned about the the year ahead because my bachelor degree was not engineering management so almost everything is new to me
this ischallenging for me
the other difference is the vle
probablybecause i did not study this major before i did not have encounter this typeof problem did not have the learning experience of this major and rarely readbooks on this subject which led to me being passive in the group
besides it can also allow much communication between the members of the group which can also promote communication and understanding between the crew
second i have never writtenreports before
because if i can not tell others about ourselves idea our partner may think i am not work hard and respect them
instead i think each task should be handed out depending on the individual in such a way so that everyone completes to the best of his ability a certain section of the project
as we known we have limited time and energy so we can not do everything well so we need to manage our time
my courses are complex and diverseincluding practical courses like c programming and theoretical courses likebusiness management
at the beginning i felt very hard to understand what lecturers were saying when they speak in a high speed
and the whole group work will finish
so i willpractice it repeatedly in my masters program and keep these statements inmind
so i think is really nice to practice collaborative work in the following modules
firstly it is necessary to preview the course go to the class with the questions and write down the answers to these questions in the notes so as to achieve the purpose of learning
when i did the team projecti releasied that the importance of collaborationafter everyone achieve an agreementthey can make a plan and distribute their own tasks in a short time
students in my class are not as proactive or passionate as i think
about notetaking i am believed in only handwriting way can put the knowledge into the different situation to more understand the deep concept
it is a great experience during the study9
first consciousness is a particularly factor because only everyone can consciously complete their tasks are best as possible to make the whole task prefect
from my experience all lecturers are willing to take the time to further explain some concept or answer any questions during or after the lectures which is very helpful
n future group work
if all of the group members are completers and they are always waiting for missions allocated by others there is no doubt that this group will be unsuccessful
learning team work is an important thing for me also for my future job
i imagined that i will share classes with other students from different countries and different styles of life
speak clearly and easily understand and be happy to answer and reexplain when we have problems
i noticed that a classmate from spain have many experiences in engineering field and he always can catch the point about the class
i belong to extraverted sensing thinking perceiving
i am surprised to find a wellprepared induction from which i learn a lot about useful skills about library use and rules in the msc course
in my own opinion the teaching style in uk is much more suitable for me compared with my previous experience the teaching style here is focus more on the individual ability and teamworkit will let me recognize what my strength is as well as my weakness
it helped me to know a little bit about each other in my programme
also it helps us in imporving the technical skills as well as the interpersonal skills while working as a team
now i have a team in york which is consisted of 3 chinese 2 taiwanese 1 indian 1 british
therefore the combination of the two can better review the old and learn new things
the content of the slides can be clearly conveyed and the lecturer can explain the ppt well when giving us lecture
personally nostudent will show their negativity in the first week because its a positiveweek for everyone because everyone wants to meet new people
there are only a dozen students in one class
i think the engineering management profession is very useful in the future development and there was a previous senior school sister who did a detailed introduction allows us to understand the profession more deeply
taking notes in lectures asking question after class reviewing notes everyday and good time management will foster success
certainly the introduction to the university despite the pain was a bit repetitive to students who have done their undergraduate degrees here
the lecturer speaks very clearly the colour and the content of the slides are appropriate and there is no discomfort in direct contact with the eyes
i majored in accounting during the period of my undergraduate so i have some background knowledge about accounting in financial part
the library also offer coffee hot foodand other service these are very key reasons why students like study in thelibrary 3
basic knowledge in electronics such as digital circuit schematic design
the less important i will use red pen to show it
therefore when the team is working it must be compromises and concessions
all of these need collaborative learning
there are some three things surprise me in my classfirst of all nearly everyone bring their laptop to the class
sometimes i just can not make any connection about the contents because the management lectures seems focus on energy technology so far but the marketing lectures are more relevant to promoting technology
now i feel the teaching style in postgraduate is to push us to accept more not only techniques
the content of the class is different
the other activities are also good
i think that everyone in the group will use collaborative learning in the future
the major reasons for a collaborative learning failure are 1
at that period of time i can review the last lectures notes
and always at the same time that we are learning i think this is an evidence that he designs the lectures very well
jot down every new concept and term i am unfamiliar with
some terms in the engineering management were quite difficult to understand when i first saw them however through the explanation of the lecturer they were easily known in an interesting and precise way
in the lectures i found that the lecturers are always very kind and powerful
the preparatory courses are mainly taught in small classes
it is very helpful for us to have a further understanding
there are two parts to the analysison the one hand on the personal side
after i listenedothers opinions i will believe others opinions are better than my
their weakness is that they may not know much about our level of learning and the professionalism of the course so there is no way to help us plan quickly
for instance in the classes of law for engineering
i think the second principle for ethical behavior and decision making should be a big challenge
at the same time be interesting at the beginning of the speechwhich is able to catch the eye of others so that the audience can follow suit
1really different personality characteristics from teammates2strengthsgood execution weakness：not great at communication3help each other：give more suggestions and more opportunities to find a new mind for the case4factorscommunication to be a good listener trust each other patient，good team work
kind of envy that lol
it is entirely because i have some very good classmates and friends
to be honest i think when they choose their topic one of the most essential elements to think about is how can we put the theory into practice
in the past i took notes in class more slowly
in the group meeting we need to avoid the cultural differences
why do not i learn it before class especially for a student with a low level of english
every part is well designed and it flow logically from one point to the other
it is not an easy thing to avoid anyconfusion and trouble during we complete the assignments and tasks
however it could not affect us
at the same time answered questions about the exam rules that students are most concerned issue。 these courses really give me a lot of help
but out of curiosity i looked at their notes and found they were more efficient with their computer notesi hope i can learn how to take notes by computer as soon as possible
it makes me open my mind and the ways i thinking
i havent experienced any difficulty understanding lecture because of accent or word choices
i think these are what china lacks in training engineers
foster success1
yes i like it comparing with the teaching style i studied in the past this is more attractive because i can have more freedom to study some area i am interested in
i feel that after my study group has laid a deep friendship everyones attitude towards homework is gratifying
in addition making the content of the talk interesting is also important and it is a good way to bring presentation to life
6 people compose study group want to getoutstanding result in whole class and grade must cooperate sincerely blendindividual into this small collective everything is jumble up with collectiveinterest through long time training the cooperative ability that learns canrise greatly certainly
here are the important factors which are crucial for successful collaborative learningcommunicationone of the most crucial factors in collaboration is communication
it is positive as it gives familiarity and we can work more efficiently as team members and this is definitely a strength to contribute to group projects that we can both share
maybe but i think i need to study after a period of time i will get it
we have own bedroom and bathroom and we canshare a kitchen with other 5 students9 during my undergraduate years studentsof the same major often live in the same dormitory while students in mydormitory all come from different majors10 during my undergraduate years moststudents are chinese people while many students here are internationalstudents who are come from different countries like spain peru pakistanindia and so on11 during my undergraduate years the teachers ofeach subjects are fixed usually we only have one teacher in subject while we wouldhave different teaches in a subject
how can i meet the assessment
yes i am pleased to find many chinese in the programme
in the future study i should always focus on avoiding plagiarism it is the most important thing when i am writing an essay
in the task allocation i can choose which part i
for example there is a kind of atmosphere in the librarythat every people in the library are learning hardly and this atmosphere willforce myself to study hardly
otherwise it is not collaborative learning but a tutorial
we cooperate and compete with each other while we are making much progress
what impressed me the most was the high school graduationexam
also one of them has some experience in coding
thisis one of the things i need to improvehonestly i dontunderstand the meaning of the elearning log
yes it is my expectation
as human as a citizen as a part of a family community etc
i think its serious and responsible
in theprocess of cooperation people who has ability of stimulating team membersemotions contribute to stimulate the thinking of the group members and proposesmart ideas
when it is in the implementation part i have confidence in the fact that i am cooperative and be able to point out the problems in the first time
in fact the specific challenges can not be avoidedthis is a part of our work which we will do in the futurefor myself the challenges can be solved by strengthening exchanges and cooperation with my team
i am not a good student at least now i am not a good student because i am very lazy and i don  t like to be hardworking
now i can say that i very familiar with their talking stylesall lecturers teaching me make use of very clear slides and they engaged with eyetoeye contact a lot
but it seldomly happened when i was a graduate student
because lack of interest by the elements of the team poor contribution no critical thinking nor enthusiasm
sometimes a complicated challenge is proposed we can operate a collaborative learning to solve this issue
before the professional class arrangement is more concentrated primarily from monday to wednesday from the morning to the full afternoon class thursday and friday are more relaxed but the current professional class arrangement is relatively easy basically only 2 hours a day course9 the form of completion of the job is different
usually i find that this distracts me from the content of the lectures themselves and i find it difficult to focus on an take in the material
the scope and specification of the lecture is suitable in the way of he talks about
i also like recording some questions and then answer them after class
so that i tried to change my style of take notes
make my own todo list and plan my fridays and saturdays properly reducing my sunday night workload so that i can set aside more time to rest and be productive on monday
activities in group were good for our group
the normalisation of the article there is no difference in this point
it is very interesting so he can always draw my attention at his class
here i have a separate discussionforpractical courses the vast majority of the content relies on program code sobefore class i think that the mentor is going to run the code and replicatethe results on the powerpoint
i need a quiet and independent environment rather than discussion during programming and conception
and i know that i really need to use collaborative learning in future modules
especially in my programme luckily we are a very diverse group with very different backgrounds and cultures
however i also saw some students who playing their mobile phone in the class
most lectures are delivered by professors logically which always help me a lot
i want to be a distinction grade student but i am afraid that my english level and being afraid of difficulties will prevent me from being a distinction grade studenti hope i can improve myself as quick as possible to finish every final assessment
i think that the instructor often points out some points in the class such as the concept of 4p the rest of the need to understand ourselves or to find some information under the class to improve what is learned in the class
many bus routes have longdeparture intervals making it very inconvenient for students to travel
still not sure about the law module but we will see
some of my former classmates even not interest in studying or improving self which give me a negative effect
i am not sure whether i take down from what lecturers say is the most significanti tend to listen what lecturers are saying but i am easily forgetting to write down the key pointsi can easily understand most of my notes because i will review it immediately after class
some times it could be in form procrastination of things to be done at a given time but will rather postpone it
normally i use my laptop to record some key information instead of using notebook
basically，in the first several weeks i use a notebook recording every course separately
in the lecture enterprise technology and marketing of management they need a lot of knowledge of managementand in sensor and instrumentation or introduction of communication they need a lot of knowledge of mathematicsin c programming it need the code skills
they never feel bored to repeat what he have said in the lecture
i did a bigresearch in the universities options the msc offers the modules included inthe courses and one of the most important things i did a deep scholarships investigationto fulfill the expected requirements and documents
although i am an extravert i am not goodat expressing myself
group members think in different way
the classmates are hard working in class
i also like the busyness and knowledge gained from study
such as using connecting words and how to describe the main point in few sentences
in fact afterfinishing the group discussion on friday i went back to the dormitory
firstly the teaching quality is the most significant point in our study because it is related whether students could learn skills or not
in addition how to match our goals together is the same important
each major class is two hours four major classes a day and no class at noon
this is useful to my assignment when i prepare my report6
although certain lectures arent designed quite as well
for example a friend is playing a game and lack one player to accompany with himit is very urgent you dont know how to refuse but the game is not important to you
and i think the leadership and the communication are the big challenges for me
seek cooperation will happen when something cant be done before the deadline
i dont think i have more energy to assign to this activity
in my previous classes most of the courses were two hours long and i could not understand the knowledge presented in the lecture during this time
i willsuggest to meeting on the weekend
well let methink about it we have had cooperated for many times this semesterpresentations sceneries and so onon the firstclass we were totally unfamiliar with each other i am not a outgoing personand i try to be active and get everyone involved
when others ask for my experience icannot explain its basic principle clearly and others may have a misunderstandingto this problem
in the international business curriculum i learned that empathy is the necessary solution in the event of a conflict
this made me feel overwhelmed and frustrated me
in a team the similarity will make the communication more easier therefore the efficiency of the team will be improved
the slides are really based on the points that they want to say
the lecture was designed very reasonable content rich
campus atmosphere the campus atmosphere and teaching environment here can give me a lot of independent space to learn and independent space for group study
its common that every group member has hisher own thoughts which are different from each other therefore they need effective communication to make their thoughts together
finally i just talked about the contents of ppt above
so what we need to do is make a clear and reasonable division of work to let everyone in the most suitable position
but i think we need more social activities in the department
sometimes we are asked to discuss a topic in a group temporarily by the teacher in class
8 in the uk students have more free time
i realized that we are a team and we are not alone in any work
i think the lectures delivered quite well in most of the classesi can hear the lecturer clearly
for example they can completetheir learning task efficiently and with high quality 2 a strong learningability
the last but not least the conflict of ideas or the clash with the thoughts are normal in every group all need to do is to face it directly
besides we can see that teachers cited the sentences from different books from the author of the authority in that fields
yes，i will i will strictly abide by the rae ethical principles
lin wangknows how to keep the team members in the optimistic waybad take huaqing li as an example he is quitelacking of motivation at most of the time i had to push somehow all the timebut he gradually realized this problem
different ways of writing11
yin general the lectures will use slides to show the content of each lecture
i find that some students use the computer to take notes
i should be in habit of reading and thinking
the method of reference is different
some students in our class have a lot of new idea
yes i can hear the lecturer clearly even some words i dont know what the meaning perfectly but i still can understand what lecturer want to deliver
the second is the teaching style
however there are some differences1 teaching style
i think i need to spend more time on study
i think i can do my better to collect members ideas to make sure we will not troubled by some small questions to coordinate groupmembers work
they can always came up with different suggestions and they all had a good leadership ability
finally carry out a lot of casualpractice or improve cohesiveness through games
then i read a lot of literature on this subjectafter several weeks of study although i have full confidence in learning i still need to improve a lot
well studying in york is completely different as compared to my country and my bsc degree which i did from pakistan here are some main differences i would like to discuss here 1problem based learningfirstly the main difference is learning through different case studies how different organizations have been going through the different crisis and how did they come back and start their business again and get their reputation back by which we learn a lot of new tactics and methods of problemsolving skills2critical reflectionanother thing which i like and feel so much difference is university always asked us to think critically on every your act if you are fail then learn how you can improve it by critically reflect on your activities while in my country we never told us such type of activities and methods3 teaching with technologyduring my masters in university of york we are introduced to new methods of learning through technology like vle and all work is done by electronically if you have any queries use emails and you will get your answer frequently which is really good but in my first degree nothing happened just like thisyou have to go to your lecturer office or any department if you have any trouble so i am feeling so much relaxed and learned a lot of new things in this way4learn from the brightest minds with practical experienceof course what really brings their teaching to life is university teachers themselves
studying in the university of york is challenging and funnyit is beautiful and there are so many students
i also enjoyed how we got a tour of the music department as well having not seen most of their work spaces
because the contents that between two classes are totally different
5 in china presentation is not common
this will make your organization more difficult in the long run
is too early to say that there are differences between us that will affect the team work
he has not used notes yetnoel jackson i have heard well too
actually they sometimes do some interactions with students like asking somebody a question
actually in the beginningweek123 there are some little debates in the team
seeking common ground while putting aside differences
however i think i just finished the assignment in the lecture
there are different styles during courses like presentation drama case study group work and so on which i never experienced in my first degree in my hometown
in addition the engage with my eyetoeye very much
i look forward to being able to share my knowledge in this area with less experienced students
actually i learned a lot through the lectures but now i have no chance to give a formal talk so i use those skills in my daily social like chat with my friends i would have more body language than i used to be and try to have eyecontact with my friends which a little bit awkward
i find that i always finish the simple tasks first and then the harder ones
therefore it takes more time for us to reach consensus10
the guidance section has helped me a lot in terms of worklife balance it suggest me that i can get some rest or take part in some communities after studying
im afraid that i cant complete the programme perfectly but i think i have understood a lot about it so i will try my best and become the best
whenprofessors launch their courses each idea is flow from one to another likeriver
in my opinion the team will have differentroles involved in cooperation which will have different results in negativeand positive behavioron the one hand it is undeniable thatpositive behavior drives cooperation to succeed
when i review i read my notes and then review what the teacher said according to the ppt content
during the period of my undergraduate study i once carelesslycalculated the statistics of the foundation of building
besides that i think i didn  t do enough
in china i can take note on the book but we do not use the book in the class in uk6there are a lot of information on the slides in china but there just have a note on the slides in uk7
and some introduction skill also can be study it is helpful to new speaker specking
the students who are of highability once they are in a group they nay have to reduce their quality of their work because another group member doesn  t agree or understand
to solve the problem i did lots of discussion with my friends in the group and i gradually formed a special note method for myself
when i take notes i usually mark the key points especially the knowledge that the instructor has repeatedly said
the firstproblem is that sometimes i could not understand what lecturers are talking aboutbut that is objective problem i would try my best to solve it
however i also concern that i can not understand the words from teachers because english is not my mother language so i guess i should practice and practice and practice my english for a great grades during this term
i think i am getting on well with the studying
72 students were compulsory to take part in undergraduate course
we must have our own thoughts and different thoughts will collidewith miracles
sometimes we could ask some question not very related to the lecture they still answer these as well
it is very easy for our students to catch the topic and key points because they have used bullet point to emphasize some key words
this is actually unethical
not surprisingly on the day of the formal speech i spoke very well i think because i was quite confident rather than being nervous i even temporarily come up with some humorous jokes to relax the audiences i successfully finished what i want to express i also got applause from teachers and classmates
after entering graduate school i need to make clear plans and plans for my study
i found that the classmates in the class have a great change in their learning attitudes
after all a harmonious relationship is also the basis of collaborative learning
lots of people think they can not have any time to waste they must work hard at any timei am not exception i really feel urgent when i study time goes fast the day i arrived in york like yesterday one year is not long as i thoughtwhen i getting familiar with the life in york i began to indulge myself like not focus on class delay in writing assignment and sometimes i would like i do not want to do my homework cause it is a little bit hard to me but my heart told me that is wrong so i lie to myself pretend to write my assignment but my mind is not in my assignment in this situation i display some nonproductive behaviors
in between the weeks it would be better have a informal chat with your colleagues so that they you get some time off from your work as well 5
the lecturers all have the sense of humor
when i first started my study at the university of york i saw a lot of recommended reading books and i also looked for electronic books for a long time
during my study in the university of york what impressed me most was how to write papers with harvard and ieee in this course
international business will cover cultural andcrosscultural issues international trade and human resources issuestransaction risks and financial risks
this bad habit of mine would have really costed me dearly
three people got replaced that  s what igot from this situation
sometimes im reserved and enjoy staying and thinking all by myself
another important thing is learning how to listen
the collaborative learning can help me practice this kind of skill
as for me i play a teamworker in our own group maybe in the future i can combine our group members well and i can do the things they may ignore such as some details in the work
it sounds simple butthe raw material is only the most common material around us paper
being a modest person is good for success
they are rigorously using reference materials and labelling sources which is very convincing
secondly i should consider some uncertain situations that may happen in advance
communication evaluation is also the team members to sum up the learning results in the group members exchange require each team member to express as clearly as possible the views of individuals or groups but also ask the team members to learn in good faith to seek the views of other groups or to evaluate the opinions of other groups in order to understand and actively summarize3 group cooperative learning should be organically integrated with autonomous learning
for example levis model
second the division of labor is not clear the lack of a clear division of labor
cultural differences for example wheni study amazon there is no specific concept for its size in the us or the uk2
i think this is a redundant problem
i feel i can follow the lecturer very well
at last it is necessary for us to do a deep preparation for our talks
therefore i have some background knowledge about this course
do more research
when he told about different peoples behaviour in different culture he always told some jokes about that
red me well for postgraduate study and gave me a great opportunity to self reflect on my strengths and weaknesses in studying
the reason for the above reasons is large because the semester is half over i still have a lot of knowledge to learn and i still have enough knowledge to answer some questions
i have already realized that there are three main reasons would interruptme to become a grade student
furthermore i am going todiscuss with other classmates
i had a brief idea about what i was going to do this year
compared with my undergraduate study i can have more chances to improve my abilities such as teamwork ability presentation ability and time management ability
as students we have broadened our horizons and enriched our experience
every week we will spend many hours to work together4
there are some factors influencing me such as online shopping social event tv series etc
in this semester i learned how to divide the work and cooperate
besides the ppt provided by lecturers is very useful for us to prepare and review lessons before and after class
second i feel that things that i  m learning at the university of york are important practical perspective and that allows me to be continuously motivated
what factors do you feel are essential for successful collaborative learning
in fact the teaching style of the university is basically the same so it is easy to adapt
i like this major very much and look forward to the future study and life
first of all the group work is almost all complicated difficult and cumbersome tasks such as business plan
thus the most important thing that affects our team is choosing what role we will play in our team
after that i try to make notes on the key words only and follow the lectures progree
also the content of slides are very so clear that we can easily find the main points and the size of font is suitable
therefore every time you listen to the teachers course you will feel very clean and comfortable
anyway i think that i should do everything well and focus on now steps
standing in front of the desk and show your confidence
especially those that i hurriedly wrote down
we should trust our group members and if some in the group need help we should be willing to help them at once because we are a group
the main problem is most of us do not have experience that work in a team
there are around 90 percent classmates are chinese include me who are silent in all class but other foreigners are respond to lecturers actively when the questions are asked to by lecturers
i was not a very diligent person and i was not motivated enough tolearn
this makes me very fast investing a lot in learning
these two lecturer are good at concentrating students attention
they use slides to explain each lesson and they will ask many questions in the classroom
secondly everyone has advantages and disadvantages
i think i can get great improved during the time i spend in the university of york
qi chen always have all kinds of ideasand willingly to share which makes her our brainstorm queen in the team
the lecture was designed logically
i tried to startreading some books exercising
the difference between us that is our major and personality the way we choose the decision in a different view but fortunately we can get in the same point at the last
besides we should learn how to arrange our time to not to influence the team because of your own affairs
i think its good and im sure i can get my degree in the year ahead
induction programme helped me to meet people from my course and instantly get friends
in my first degree in china it is hard to enter the university but easy to graduate
9
it is very difficult to concentrate on learning
i can help them learn c language and circuit design by using experience in work for the industry
i use the game or interesting stories as a primer to lead the topic
it is very essential to show that you have innovative ideas and you can think outside the box
the mode of communication by email is different from the communication mode of frequent text messages and facetoface communication5
another point that i consider important and positively is that the record the classes
what i learned is that i should try to make the content of the lecture clear enough not too much to ensure that the audience is easy to understand
most of lectures are designed very good but the lecture of international business maybe is not very clear
the final homework may not be qualified work because every assignment need more and more research to support evidence and give a power point less time can not finish this work
my team members are very united
however it is not allowed to start work only before the deadline
the explanation of the course is clear and logical but the class may be a little depressing and boring and the course itself is not easy to understand
looking forward to it the next term
if i can not management my time i will bear very serious consequences in the future
besides that will deeply influence us in the area of law
4 lots of programming i knew i was going to learn programming but didnt expect this much of work
knowledge
the lectures urge us to read them before or after class
the first is content
secondly i think i am a little “ quiet ” in the lecture in other words i am lack of motivation
i think it will be my expected
finally at the university of york there are better hardware facilities and more humanized service for students
after two months i have been able to keep up with the progress of my study and arrange my time properly
after that we could do everything the best
at the first time i did my course project i did not listen to the suggestion from others
team members should explain concepts thoroughly to each other
however there are also some behavious that can hinder success such as aimlessness laziness and so on
taking notes should be selective purposeful and targeted
i am happy to listen introduction
i came to england and english is my second language
the activities had more to do with the specific module oriented concepts like strategic management how to work together as a teamhow well do we understand each others opinions
of course i am trying my best to change myself to become a good person
at the same time the surrounding environment whatever the living environment and dietary habit both have changed dramatically
studying in britain requires more independence and selfconsciousness
third members don  t show the respect toeach other
in university of york i can directly noticed that every one is busy and has lots of work to do and most of them love studying and visiting library for further knowledge7
if i am concentrated on taking notes i would miss a lot of information during the lecture
however the professors and doctors even the demonstrator in the lab session here in my opinion are much better than i had experienced before
i was surprised that the department is really helping students to be prepared for job markets
when we talk with each other we can directly notice others opinions
i will need to learn fast so that i cancompete wellfinally university of york is unique place andspecially the department of electronic
if i need collaborative learning in the future i will first clarify the division of labor and ensure that everyone participates in cooperative tasks and then carry out effective discussion communication and operation
for the most timei can get the the key information and points in classand i can understand what the lecturer have delivered to us however when the time last too longi maybe miss some key points and information
i am very happy with the firstweek feelings
i think so
when i was in university in china teachers seldom asked for preview nor did they provide materials before class
for me although my study may not be as good as others i will use my spare time to enrich my life and increase my personal temperament
without them i think most of my time may be watching movies playing games and learning until i have to do iti dont want to go out of my comfort zone
master at york university there are many differences compared to our national research institutes
when i give a talk firstly i should put myself into my audiences shoes so i will consider my audience what they want to know
and i always want to learn how to do a humorous talk and how to get the attention from audiences
i think the lecturer has clear logic having a deep understanding of the content to be taught
this makes it easier to remember what the model says and to get a better sense of how its used in practice
every lecture tutors can speak all of the content it is clearly so i think i can understand 80 of all
finally we will conquer every problems and finish the whole teamwork assessment together
fortunately the method does work and it has improved my speed of taking notes
additionally there are many interactions between teachers and students
i wrote an article in my blog about how to not waste time and how to defeat the monster of procrastination
i dont like large sections of text so my record book is generally the most important concept to illustrate which is the key pointfor how to analyze possible problems my method is to contact the teachers points expand the relevant knowledge and use the examples to analyze the actual situation
however on some issues there will be differences of opinion
for example in my job as a resident engineer
actually i did not have questions
i have made up my mind that i will achieve distinction grade after the end of the course and in this year i will try my best to improve my english
describe several students how
in every growth stage we will face different issues
at the beginning i couldnt understand the content of the class
i know that my classmate from chine donot like to talk so much
now i give up steady work and study abroad
my transition in studying at york have changed over time
every time thomas can make each team member play his special skills to complete the group workso i think that having strong leadership correct thinking and reasonable arrangements makes it easier for us to succeedin fact everyone will delay the progress of learning laziness teamwork is not easy to hinder success but the members of our group are very harmonious and everyone is doing their homework on time
every single project we have received so far has made me consider how the main idea could be used into a full research project
as a overseas student sometimes i can not understand the content but if we have clear slides i can review the content after class
using the main point and combine with the companys case
preparing and a positive mindset from now on is very important
our students can benefit a lot from this class
for example when we talked about our business plan and ideas for enterprise
all the knowledge you have absorbed in classwould only be represent on you final report which will determine your couldpass or not
although i sometimes have some negativelearning situations myself i will encourage myself to overcome everydifficultyon the onehand negative situations are inevitable and i was negative before i becamedisciplined
the teacher told us the correct answer is not just one and we can have many different answers and there is no standard answer for us
writing requirements previous articles may not require much knowledge
teamwork is not flexible so sometimes not everyone has the same schedule to have a group meeting which makes it more difficult to communication2
i will compete at veryhigh level
non sense of responsibility is one of the reasons for team failure
i think powerpoint is very convenient to take the audience from that to the next point
after constant revision i finally finished the outline
inthe future i will try my best to overcome these shortcomings and form thesegood habits
for example our group don  t have a fixed leader we only have theweekly leader
yes i like the level of interaction but sometimes i think that the time for discussion is so limited
i think it  s fun to raise the oranges，which makes me surprise
yes there are some courses that i have not learned before
international business the lecturers voice is very loud and penetrating without using a microphonemanagement and marketing of technology classroom is fun and interesting often with eye contactlaw for engineering management different lecturers have different stylesmsc personal effectiveness and masterclasses this class talks about how to use eye contact body language etcstrategy management for em the lecturer takes care of every classmate and then has a lot of eye contact
therefore we got the praise of the teacher which made us happy and confident to do next pre
it is the most important for me to talk with my supervisor i get more information about the campus and i feel less stressful than before because i did not know my major and my career in the future a lot before
if i study hard in high school and reduce some unnecessary entertainments i can have a better score
i carefullylisten and grab salient points of lecturer in a particular module
there are some problem
the main example of this would be the tower building exercise where all we had was paper and tape to make a tower that can balance an orange on top yet remain stable to outside forcesthe activity that could possibly change would be the sessions which required the students to talk among themselves regard a topic as each time period given to talk to one another was not sufficient to engage on a meaningful level
i think the more we indulge into our own activities and along with this also help others it would benefit us in a lot of ways
enterprise from my perspective the class of this course is quite useful and we should do a whole business plan during the process of this class
yes i think my study will be really substantial
firstly all the teachers use clear powerpoint to help students understanding the context
the lectures were pretty good in my point and i am really positive about those teaching styles that i mentioned in last questionevery lecturer would like use their microphone so everyone can hear words clearly even if they set the latest
on the one handthe efficiency of our meeting is slow and we sometimes waste much time duringthese process
first of all i think the lecturers scope and specification are very clear and they always tell the students about their theme at the first time in the lecture
for example the lecturer used a humor video to show the language is an important thing in international business
the instructor is responsible for giving a big direction and the rest of us rely on ourselves to complete the study
in addition the occurrence of laziness will seriously affect the efficiency of collaborative learning
just can  t easilychange the whole mind set but we will see
thislearning process is memorablemy undergraduate major is environmentaldesign which is a little bit different from em
it often happens in myself
i wouldnt i am up to date with my assignments and the work assigned to me but i am trying really hard to cope with the limited time that i have
i think it  s good to add some jokesin the presentation
of course i aspire to be a distinction grade student
maybe i will not bea distinction grade student in the begging but i will bea distinction grade student in the future
besides i think to much about some important things in future recently
when i came to the uk to study for a masters degree we had our tutor and a lot of homework and discussions were conducted in a group of 6 tutors
i enjoy teamwork and i was fortunate that our team won the prize in the production of the supporting orange model
its usually from the brain alongside power point slides
besides the body language is significant
i will learn from them a serious academic attitude and optimistic mind
there is no group work in china3teaching in china is in chinese and in britain is in english4at the end of the semester in china they are all exams but in britain there are exams and papers5in britain people from all over the world will study in the same classroom6previous majors were more about technology but now they are more about theory7there are only two semesters a year in china and three in britain8learning in britain requires thinking more for myself9there is no reading list in china
superior members ofter resent having to carry weak or lazy students and worry that their grades will be lowered by having to work with such students4some students fail to participate in the group work at all but pressure their peers to put their names on the group report5partition of the work among team members means that no one does every step of the assignment so no one completely understands the entire exercise and 6group comprehension of collaborative exercises has been poor
but actually the first time i met some of them they seemed to avoid eye contact with me
1 my bachelor  s degree is in automation which shapes my mind into an engineer but the engineering management program require me to think like a manager act like a manager
for instance she put chocolates to everyone and encourage us to think and practice
bribe must be the biggest challenge in future life
lazy to think and do not have a clear life plani think students who have a clear life plan and make efforts to their goals my succeed easily
only by thinking of what others cant think of and creating something new will you have more chances to succeedteamwork is also very important
so i could understand better when john teach us different cultures from different areasi also read some case before we started the law of engineering management because i believe that ethics is certainly significant in our engineering work in the future as well as law is a little difficult fo me because it is abstract
but i really enjoy the progress
first in the lecture i used to use computers to record the notes or important points and see the slides
for example in ios module andy showed us previous msc students work and explained how it works
once again due to being familiar with the university and even more with the department i had a good idea of what i was getting into
if i read the weather forecast before the day and leave a part of time for the traffic jams the bad experience may not happenafter that day the similar things havent happened to mepunctuality is very important for being a distinction grade studentif you submit your report late or you are absent for your presentation or exam it is nearly impossible to get a distinction gradenow i feel im a bit stubborni think i should listen to others opinions and learn to change my own ideasim a bit perfectionist i should be more tolerant towards others flawsand allow myself and others to make mistakes
and there is one more session that i think is useful
all of these things are common badbehaviours and in those cases i may know that it is wrong but like a drugaddict does not try to control their behaviour
in my home university even when there are some exchangestudents in different courses they are less than 1 of the total studentpopulation10 facilities i think that here in york there are somegood facilities laboratories and in general good infrastructure to support allthe students activities from classes to sports and culture
i think lecturers should use their experience to make sure their scope and specification of the lecture
i will take and use the important information from lecture and i also will take the information from recommended book list moreover i also take some useful information by my self and i will use all these information to improve me
yes the induction programme surprised me a lot and i am very happy during these three days
i always take notes by handwritingand take the key points in my notebookusually i am able to understand my notes when i review them
in facti never met this situation beforebut when i was in my undergraduate college i ever heart from my friend that one person cheated in one exami think it is contrary to the rae ethical principles
however there is very little content on my ppt so even when i finished my presentation there were 4 minutes left
join a group and work with people whose from different countries
however i believe that this will be slowly improved in future cooperation and studies
most helpful the information about vle and elearning two games tower of york another game that i forgot the name
i was not so hard as myprediction because we are all chinese and we try to show our friendlinessto finish ourfirst assignment we got together and discussed about it i found it was veryawkward if there were nobody stand out and saying something and everyoneshould treat assignment seriously even one person would have bad effect to others passionate
for example we cancooperate to make assignment
in my expectation i would have many foreign classmates and i could talk with them to develop my english
whats more the common phenomenon is that those students with excellent academic performance have a common characteristic that is they can voluntarily and voluntarily study
by the way we build a shared group for some reading list we need to read for our lecture which i think it is really good idea
during my high school years i took notes in a completely different way from the notes i take after my undergraduate since during that time i learnt how to take notes properly and take the notes that really matters
but when i was in college my classmates were all chinese
i really liked the resilience and the orange session ones
actually it was so hard to collect all of the information in limited time
3 they have a strong thirst forknowledge
in addition everyone have own opinion at the begaining and we didnt decided which one is best before we start which led us change ways during the towermaking
you can enjoy other people  s working skills and effective methods for free
in collaborative learning we can also help each other
it takes more time to study read and understand knowledge2
1use a humorous tone or example occasionally to liven things upland once to focus the audience and deepen their understanding of the speech2share my own story or use myself as an example to start a conversation3dont hesitate to answer questions and have a simple conversation with with the questioner4have naturally coordinated body language such as body movements gestureseye contact and smiles5ask the audience questions but dont force them to answer them6if i have slides keep them simple and dont only read the prepared slides7the content should be logical and organized so that it is not only clearer to speak by itself but also easier for the audience to understand
i have the habit to take notes since i was in middle school where we were compulsive to take notes in class
no nothing surprised me
at the same time the consistency between each point is strong during the lecture this is because the lecturers will use some concrete examples to summarize each knowledge point
the basic tool of transportation in taiwan is motorcycles
now i have a supervision group with other five classmates and i need to lead the group which makes me a little bit tired but i only need to guarantee my own study before
3in terms of assignments yorks work is more practicallike doing a presentation or a drama or cooperating with team while in china it is mostly written work
actually there are other culture shock that i came cross and i gradually became adapt and even like the lifestyle in york2
however in my group there are some guys they do not do anything
it is sure not what is obtainable from my past experience
the basic problem of oneselfbecause my undergraduate degree is not a major related to engineering management it may be a little difficult for students to study in some courses3
as a graduate student we have higher requirements
at the same time timely to answer and understand these labelling places is also very helpful for future testingafter using this method of notetaking i think there is a significant improvement in my study
i  m not making unnecessary or trivial notes i  m trying to indicate possible test questions through the material that was presented on the lectures and workshops what lecturer was focusing on what it seems to be important and crucial for a particular topic
i want to be a distinction grade studentagainbut be a distinction grade student has a lot ofchallenges
i could hear the lecturer clearly
however there are still have some academic works confuse me
unclear and inconsistent collaborative learning purpose
bad choices came here
i found it useful to have team working activities with the other students on the amt course it helped us all to get to know one another
because of it it can inspire us studying hard8
but to be honest diversity not only will create value but also cause serious disagreement even make conflict
some lectures such as dr north who is together with us in strategies and operations management on friday often provide the suggestion with the examples of actual situation in work or life
especialy there are a person who come from india we need to speck english in whole activity to let him understand our ideas
more reading list than before
i write the important thing on the right if it is really important i will use red pen to highlight it
worst case scenarios includes student not even turning up to their lectures however its hard to say whether this can foster or hinder success
in our group everyone has their own strengths
but for me there are many shortcomings that prevent me from becoming a good student
at the same time the task must be completedwithin the time specified in the mission
they do engage with my eyetoeye very much
im not sure that these things can quickly help me change my thinking i think it needs a long time to orientation
the mode of submission of assessment is quite different too from the norm of physical submission of assignments or other reports during undergraduate days back in my home country7
i think that the approach used here is very useful because after attending the lecture you have a long lab session normally in the same week to try by yourself the concepts that have been given in the lectureanother main difference is the number of modules per term that we have here and that i had in my previous degree
i was happy with the induction programme it engaged well with the audience especially in the innovation tasks with supervision groups it acted as an ice breaker
i think it will be more useful than i expected
i conclued these points use your hand guesturesmake eyetoeye contactfacial expressions manage voice level sometimes use prompts if unpractised
these teachers slides orteaching methods are more interesting than my previous teachers which makes memore focused on class
for example i have read some case about law and i can not understand the differences between china and england so i have to check some documents to enhance my understand and sometimes i need to check chinese documents because english documents is to difficult to learn
but bidyut has enough patients to answer the details carefullyenterprise noel and bidyut have given us enough instructions and when we have some problems about arguments in our group business plan i always ask advice from them
i learned to work harder to complete my work so that it doesnt affect others
it also good for us to review at the end of the class
if speaker can use the ppt they will can show the catalogue or background by the slides
sharing everyones ideas so we can all come to a final conclusion and something that everyone agrees with it
i have missed the introduction week so im little confused about some details about msc in em
they answer questions by always using the answer that suitable for students
they are all very patient
in most occasions i am very patient and carefully however i might be very impatient and easy to lose temper when i meet some problems that worry me a lot
in addition i think the most important thing is the logic of speech
because i believe that adhering to these statements can not onlygain the respect of others but also the strength of a team
when standing on the platform you should believe in yourself and be willing to tell the audience your ideas
this will be able to meet ourneeds and develop our abilities as much as possible
but students have more opportunities and enough time to know each other because they live together rather than in msc we can rarely know some names of classmates
because everyone is not enough to understand each other they are not familiar with the characteristics and personality of each person
all of them have original idea and very brave to express own opinions
after the class focus on the game ratherthan preview and consolidate the knowledge
in terms of the challenges i realized that i am not good at leading a team
i havent touched many courses before
i have learnt a lot from the lecturer
in that case everyone has their personal opinions and it can cause disagreements when we make team meeting to about our missions
i think others is normal i expect other student can listen me carefully and give me some feedback on time
thatnight i thought a lot i remembered my father used to say to me people shouldstrive hard when they are young or they will surely regret when they are oldi decided to make a change to be a more diligent person to be more active inlearning and that was a sign of taking responsibility for myselfi have the bad habit of staying up late
this is one of the concerns
i think everyone will have such a desire
when i have several missions to complete at the same time i do not have a specific planning for which item i need to do fist and which one next
when i use it next time i can clearly know what my notes record and i will use different colors of pens to record the pity of different importance
first of all i think every teacher is very experienced
i found it useful to reappraise my professional skills after having just spent a year out of university in industry and that i was able to meet other people from my course during them
when i was a college student in china i participated in a student union organization
the brain releases a chemicaldopamine when it experiences an enjoyable behavior
in my opinion the biggest help for me is how to learn in university of york
i found that pills from the south of china tended to think over and over again before they worked out the conclusion
the activity like tower is needed to add more
for example previously i thought this program will completely focus on engineering area but the truth is it also pay attention to commercial area
my ability to take notes in class is not very strong
sorry i havent attended classes much time
it is very easy to accept
for example dr noel and baruah both teachus in the enterprise lecture
one is individual work and the other is groupwork
i think it  s a basic thingwe need to do in our study we should take responsibility for our self
i think the interaction between the different cultured students havent been that friendly
for example there will be some differences between the test points in memory and the actual test points so the habit of not taking notes will directly lead to my failure in the exam but also let me do not have a deep impression of the general knowledge of learning
another problem is that when i meet dont know the word ill look up the meaning of it and then down in a notebook for the rainy time out and back but i found that the habit of recording new words still retains the i dont have any words that notebook back down one by one and there are a few words in two or three times
what is important they can find theirinterest in reference books and put himself into it
secondly in the undergraduate room each of us comes from different majors so that everyone can communicate and solve each other when encountering problems in different fields
the tutors or lecturers usually have some interactions with students i believe it is a good way to get feedbacks directly
the first one is when everyones opinions are not uniform all of group are not willing to make concessions
sometimes the teacher would ask the students some questions and then choose the answers related to the topic he was going to talk about as the starting point
he always defends theirargument to convince us
nº
not only can i get timely feedback but i can alsoexercise my communication skills
thinking abilitywhat you have now is probably a fixedsolution thinking and there is very little innovation which is what you need to cultivate this year
however in the current school relatively speaking the class time is not fixed
if i still confuse with the problem i will keep doing more further reading and take more notes about it until i could understand it
as the saying goes the soldiers who don  t want to be generalsare not good soldiers
all knowledge is related to technology and management knowledge is not involved
to be honest i have not met with the problem that contrary to the rae ethical principles
but ingeneral i write memos to remind myself of important issues
there are many essential factors for successful collaborative learning since we can pick them up and handle them we can cooperate well with each other
good communication ensures everyones opinions but bad communication will make the team have no motivation to cooperate
in class i basically just listening to different lecturers teach i will not take the time to take notes because im afraid i can not keep up with the content later
it was a new building that was constructed two years ago however some citizens found there were some little cracks on the wall that was one of my friends flat
the lecture is designed well
he has used microsoft word
becauseof the unified learning objectives like the common academic mark incollaborative learning each team member is the supervisor and each otherchecks the missing parts in the group worksecondly collaborative learning is amicrocosm of teamwork in society
however in york teachers prefer to assign essay or report for us
actually it  s not a good habit for me because it  s really unnecessary to use personal computer instead of using notebooks
the teacher lectures like a presentation
looking back on the past i kept a high academic performance duringmy undergraduate period especially for those important subjects forengineering management like statistics91 engineering mechanics92modern quality management87 intelligent building91 foundationand subgrade89 engineering drawing90 engineering surveying91cad95
you may already have a profile set up on one or more social media sites
well in my opinion the lecture was in a reasonable pace
it may beeasy for me to distract myself
my ability
never think about the lectures4
on the other hand our team work process can be delayed
i think its a quite good way in the lecture where we could come into cantact with professional person and gain knowledge in the first hand
i hope it is easy and enjoyable
the more the merrier
i am so sorry i have not asked any questions so far
this is a useful resource for when you come to preparing to give a talk which you will be soon in the international business module
while i making the presentation i will try to start with a relevant story or joke to get every audience involved into the topic and obtain their attention then i will move to the main part
i will expressmy views on the learning content as much as possible and listen to differentopinions from othersinthe collaborative learning environment we are challenged both socially andemotionally as they listen to different perspectives and are required toarticulate and defend their ideas
moreover we can shall knowledge which means we can be improved together
well i have to say that its the first time that i am taught in a western teaching style which is quite different from what i accepted in china
i am able to follow the engineers code of conduct and try my best to do every job and academic course
but now i realise how much important ethics play a role in our life
futhermore i hoped that i could learn more knowledge from classmates and teachers
repetitive work may be done because group members are not clear about his allocated assignment and communicate little with each other
1 feel free to assign cooperative study groups
in the specification he used case study and express them specificallyin the class of international business ji talked about the differences in cultures differences in peoples behaviors and other aspects
these slides can be downloaded to view in advance making our study more convenient
then i can try to avoid making mistakes and achieve a better result
usually i study individually therefore i always finish my assignment or prepare for the exam by myself
so i decide to get up early in the rest of time no matter it is weekdaysor weekends in order to read something in the morning
i find that all students in our group are very individual so it can be easy to get some creative ideas but it may also be difficult to collaborate
some internet applications are also collaborative learning with the outside worldteamfor the team we will pay more attention to our efficiency
tutor give us a lot of reference books toread in york but the tutor in the first degree can not give us an abundantresource for us to consult2
i also have a good vision for the future
in our group we have a lot of different personality team members we can use different strengths to complement each other to achieve better teamwork
international business john prefer to talk with students he told us stories about our class topic
over the past few weeks i have observed our performance in classi think in the past few weeks we have been busy with our study but we have not been slack
secondly my free time is unavailable until the weekend thirdly i am lack of knowledge and skills
especially during class the teacher will not stop so i have no way to completely record all the content
at the same time i will add my understanding to the notes so that i can better understand when reviewing and avoid the situation where i cant read the notes
they are all nice and warmhearted
i have to face unfamiliar environments strangers language barriers and other difficulties
for example when the group make adecision about the name of our business plan
therefore we know what we are going to learn every single class
i think i can have more creative thinking to be a better teamworker
there are also references when cite something and the overall feeling is very suitable
personaleffectiveness and masterclasses aim to enhance students personal developmentand professional potential
when some people are stubborn and unwilling to accept the ideas of others the team will become a mess and it will easily fail
i think the communication and knowledge sharing among the team members is the most important reason for the teams work to achieve the final result
her class is the easiest to understand for most of her classmates because her pronunciation is clear and the outline of the course is simple to understand
the sessions in the afternoon makes me learn more about the structure of our classit help me a lot in make a plan for my future study
in the internatinal businesssometimes i can not understand what the lecturer said but the lecturer always engage with oour eyetoeye in his lecture which is very good
i used to read only on textbooks but now i am a diverse student
we can know what he will go to explain
our group sometimes quarrels over some trifles
i believe that all of my groupmates are very creative and helpful
i have reflected on all my behaviours and thoughts in the past and i have shortcomings in two aspects which are accuracy and rigor and responsible leadership
perhaps a bit of a fly in the ointment is that the teachers slides are not perfect lacking some graphics and a more visual explanation
in addition when we are doing the presentation we can use signposts and suitable pause and avoid using hard academic terms frequently
the learning environment here isgreat
what are their strengths and weaknesses
it is really beneficial for every post graduate student to work together
b
whats more i think i need to switch off my phone so that i wont get attracted by other messages
the first thing is culture in my group there are five chinese two from taiwan the other is an indian we sometimes have different way of thinking
for the good news we have vle records we can review the videos anytime we want and check our notes if we dont know what we wrote
however the knowledge i learned here is more management oriented which broadens my scope of knowledge2the form of homework is different and the homework in china is more targeted with the example mentioned in class as the template
3 meals never happy with meals on campus
after two months studying in york i think i have adapted to the studying and life here
firstly we should make the strengths bigger and make the weakness smaller
in terms of teaching style here it needs more students participation in the learning process here such as reading a lot of relevant materials before and after class need people spend more time to think
it is difficult to guarantee no bias
they showed their proficiency in lectures
by this is possible to know better the other students their ideas and knowledge
not have situations at the moment and ill be careful afterwards
besides there always have someone late for the courses and enter the class through the front door which will distract other fellows to some extent
he did not try out speakersbefore lecturejoannanorth is clear in her lecture
at first the students should be active in class and always interact with the teacher
but in the group i know that when others have different ideas we need to understand others ideas and analyze which one is betterthen i know how to assign tasks
team learning can promote personal growth
i always feel overconfident in most of the challenging circumstances though i have succeeded sometimes i have always wanted to change that in me so that it could help me in developing myself to achieve my academic and professional goals
i tried to answer but i felt nervous i am still trying to deal with it
i rarely check information and study alone in china
the teacher pour knowledge into our head and we have to listen and remeber and attend exams
more lectures8
finally the spirit of never give up is a powerful slogan
if it is because of my reasons for these tragedies i will think this is a shame for my life
i have not found a good solution in this regard i will continue to work hard
we have to be honest to each other9
all my notes are equally important
sometimes it is because the key of the issue is not fully understanding because of the language problem or we can understand the teachers question but we can not quickly organise english sentences to express it
all we need to do is to devote time to reading the book lists and keep thinkingit is not such a difficult thing for me to solve with the living environment i am more resilient than i has anticipated before i come here
more international students in university of york
i can list one bad habit on myself
through group cooperation i realize that teams are stronger than individuals
for a speaker to give a speech on a topic first they should explain the topic of todays speech at the beginning of the speech and it is better to have some explanations to help the audience understand the topic more easily
almost all of the classmates are very serious in their studies
the slides are made in a very clear style full with useful pictures and symbols
another issue is not listening other peoples
otherwise some people will do more thanothers while others will do less
both the teacher and the classmates thought that i was doing better than the last time
when i sit in front of the classroom i can clearly hear what they are saying
how well i am coping with the academic work my aspiration tobe a distinction grade student and finally my weaknesses
very much satisfied with the answers that i got from them
in this way they give me some inspiration and let me know how to think about problems in different ways
this mainly reflects that i still lack a certain degree of planning and selfdiscipline in time management
however in each class i take notes
each student has a specific supervisor the supervisor can know our problems and can give us some specific suggestions
i hope i can also interact with lecturers boldly in future classes which is a good opportunityin addition i dont think i can take notes while listening to lectures so more often i just listen to what the lecturer has said but occasionally i will write down the key words and then look up relevant information for further understanding when i go home
using list is easier for me to review my notes after class or after meeting
i have read 14 copies of preliminary reading and found 56 mistakes in these materialsi then report these mistakes to tutor （helen smithhoweveri do not think finding incorrect euqtions can prove i am good at these knowledgeit is also difficult to remember some abstract formulas
i saw that the teachers curriculum materials include research from books journals etc which are all available after class
3 different sorts of group activities are requested during the course and it really enhanced my communicating skills
we have different culture different thinking i think that will help us be successful
individuals involved should be ready to share knowledge and cross vitalize ideas on the subject matter2
hold regular group meetings to summarise the progress and problems of the discussion group so as to prepare for the next assignment
this scope help students practice coding who dont have knowledge about programming in swift
answering the questions in a comprehensive and meticulous manner should result in better resultsto be honest i think it is really hard for me to get distinct grade
most students are from the same country with me
by working on strategy management assignment i learned how we can implement tool and techniques with real business models and analyze the complete business by using theory
in fact sometimes we can not help ourselves with the small talks which are bad to keep going
besides they are very humorous and often use some funny examples to make us understand knowledge deeply
presentation
we have five senses inorder to understand the world
students have a clear task of learning can avoid the blindness of group cooperative learning adequately reflect the effectiveness of group cooperative learning2 communication evaluation
actually i always using collaborative since i enter my undergraduate course
for example team members can not share team results with others and team members always delay their tasks and affect the progress of learning projects
just trying to find myself in a new country and enjoy this “ adventure ”
at the same time i also hope that i can humbly ask those top students to learn that i dont know how to study so as to improve my study skills
i always think whether i am a stupid personi dont know how to be a top studentbut i think we should try
i really like to have more talk with lecturers and classmates
noel jackson also respondedgood my questions
the activities about team work was helpfuli think it was good
in the last one i always did some design work by myself
after working and studying for a long time i may lose my love for the profession which will affect my pursuit of more advanced knowledge
i also be asked that when we read books or articles we should use critical thinking and the context may not be all right in the books or in the articles
i took notes while listening to the teacher but because my listening level is very poor it is difficult for me to fully understand the content of the class that the teacher is talking about
the more viewpoints are conducive to figure out questions
this is very surprisingi am looking forward to finding more creative ideas being able to remain sensitive to the profession and being able to share knowledge with others and learn different perspectives from others
students in our class are serious about assignments and spend many time on discussing with othersfor examplewe were asked to prepare a theatrical performance on international business last week and some group did a perfect job which really took them lot of time preparingi expected the class would be very activebut it seems students in our class are hesitated to express themselves including me
i use different colors of mark pens to show levels of significance and i usually mark stars behind the notes that i think it is important
however this may lead other team members to misunderstand that i am not actively involved in the work and just want to finish the discussion earlieri would like to show that i like teamwork which can simulate our future work mode and cultivate our communication and execution ability
we will support each other
the only lectures so far that really reguired notetaking are the lectures that do not support lecture capture
there also a lot of discussion between students
there is a saying in china that the difficulty is like a spring
in the last degree we have to finish the exercises assigned by the teacher in each class and move our homework to the teachers office by the class representative before the next class7the method of contacting the teacherin york when we want to contact the teacher we can send an email to the teacher
as long as one team member does the laziest thing and delays the deadline then the rest of the team will delay together and slowly vicious circle
it is prefect but i think our college can give us some information for future career
we have worked in groups in the ppp workshops and in few lab sessions
we can know the connect of the lecture through ppt and we can download them from vlethe teacher will write the important content on the ppt and then each content will be explained and analyzed carefully
the power of a team is always larger than a person
even i once forgot one work totally and i received the punishment i deserved
i usually work inefficiently because of being easy to be distracted and having bad time management especially when i am in college i have a lot of spare time to arrange by myself
i do suggest him simply to change thebattery next time if it happens again
i have been in the uk for more than one month but the same problem seems to reappear
the role of coordinatoris fundamental
i do a good preparation before class such as looking at the courseware in advance and figuring out the unknown words
to be honest i do not think i am good at taking notes because i will be distracted by taking notes when i am listening to the content i would miss the key point of the lecture
yes i think this style is better than i experienced
yesi can
i do not know why i am used to be late in many situations i am late on class i am late on date and party
also lets the team down if no one speaks
as for the behaviours which will hinder success i can list several points
if you ask me that am i want to be a good student definitely yes
this is useful as the student knows what to expect as a learning outcomes
doodle translate will lead me to be a person who always usechiness english
at present my academic performance in general most of our courses or on the basis of the study including business marketing and technical courses such as programming basis and foundation of signal i think everyone came to york university is the excellent student want to be a have many abilities but before the goal need a lot of effort you will first need to good enough knowledge this is our current stage the second we need plenty of experience which includes interpersonal experience also include the project experience of course also need a good teami now difficulties mainly come from the lack of information the school provides many learning materials but dont know what is what we really need and i to screening of this piece of information is scarce especially in the study materials including the content of the different content such as at the same time involved in technology research and talk about market analysis of this problem let me very upset because im not good at understanding both the content of the meanings another difficulty is that i am satisfied with the present team isnt particularly two foreign students thinking logic and i difference is bigger is i cant understand what they think ofso i have a very negative reaction at times
i am excited about the induction programme especially about the innovative activity
what surprises me
7
i often use my ipad to take notes and there are two parts ofnote first part is taken in the class i would download the slides before theclass if it is possible and i would like to write note on the slide pages directlythe second part of the note is taken after class i would like to organize theminto the notebook and use the different color pen in order to show the levelsof significance of notes
in york i need to learn the balance of work and life
the ability of selfstudy is very important for me during these two months
finally while inclusive understanding i also learned to discover the strengths of others to learn and absorb the advantages of others
regarding notes i downloaded the ppt in vle in class and marked it directly in the notes column at the bottom of the ppt
i hope lecturers could more interact with students
little teaching takes place now while more learning self study is the norm2
i see this app as my own bookshelf
i didnt have much group work this term but i feel like i need to be a good listener
yes i love the teaching style here it combiles lectures and practical and all teachers are very nice and patientwhat i experienced in the past is much lectures and examinations it was stressful but got low capability
and i wont force others to agree with me
the fourth point is to focus on teamwork and enhance teamwork
in asian homework is homework it is not interesting it is so academic and tasteless25 collaborate uk education system really focus and care the teamwork no one can handle the whole teamwork it more like cooperate however in asian we are competitive education system we fight each other to get no126 in wast country university really care about the academic misconduct everything should be followed the rule well we can see it from vle submit time27 the most important point and is this way i want to study aboard here in the uk there is no correct answer people care about how you use the tool and your opinion and thought i really like this point in my country always have the right answer i dont like this bad education systemthird study environment38 there is a lot of communication area in the college people can share their idea in the area
keep the modest attitude
for my academic work i will actively listen to the class write down the important part of the teacher and take notes carefully
there are so many differences between my first degree and here
i always be sure of the power of team is larger than a persons
once ihave any inattention i can not follow the lecture
reviewing the history a lot of great trams broke from internal
in fact most of my body language in my speech was learned from my lecturer
someone prefers to prepare every aspect of the work well then start to work on the project
time has passed really fast and as we can see we are already in the fifth week of the first term
our teachers even the guests from the law firm are patient andmindful when answering my questions
every student regardless whether they have background knowledge could learn new knowledge during the lecture
in many cases we need to complete a complex task in thegroup and excellent task allocation will greatly improve our overallefficiency
most of the students are enthusiastic
i believe it is useful during my master study
if i can not answer them correctly i will see the answer on my notebook
they have different role characteristics
life is short so even work has been enjoyedat times if i will not complete everything you had on my list
i am diligent in thinking dare to raise doubts have unique insights into knowledge have a certain spirit of innovation and strive to pursue perfection in learningif i want to be a good student threes attributes can help me in my studiesfirstly a a sense of responsibility is important for building a sound characterif i am not responsible i ll postpone my assignments or devote too little time to my school worksecondly in school life relationships between people are valuable
most of the purpose of chinese education is to find a good job and the british style is more focused on the cultivation of abilities and intereststhird there are textbooks in class in china and there are no textbooks in the ukfourth there are many ways in the uk to show what you have learned
sometimes i can not take a beautiful notes and even logical confusion that will affect my next review
i need to strengthen my exercise in this areain my life the biggest bad habit is that i lack sports and are lazy
i think these two challenges will also appear in future group projects
the teacher prefers to interactwith classmates
not only that but such grouping is also natural to make students from unhealthy psychological quality2 the distribution of cooperation objectives is unclear
academic writing
i feltthat she knew about our knowledge of the topic
this part helps us that we could understand the theme more
for the reason that i had to finish all the assignments and had to make the timetable for next week
i think the key to collaborative learning is the relationship between group membersits easy to succeed when we have common goals
i hope so
management its a really good module for our future as it will further establish us in a more managerial position
here we have more free time to learn and more reading lists
the lectures for management amp marketing of technology are very clear and well delivered with the lecturers opting to use microphones to project their voice across the lecture theater
so i began to shorten my notes from long sentence to simple keywords and indeed it worked much better
students in our class are divided into several groupssome of them are willing to cooperate with others and are very patient with group members
additional i use some theory of the hofsted insights websitereference httpswwwhofstedeinsightscomcountrycomparisonchina
they define their own lectures to guide students to have the correct direction of thinking
during the undergraduate period i have textbooks
we discussed about legal system in uk
therefore during this course i can learn more about the different cultures between different countries
as known to all deadline is the first productive forces
yes they have a nice design
so to come tostudy to pay the tuition fees and have money to the daily life i needed toget a scholarship
i could hear the lecturer clearly the slides are clear
therefore i think we should spend some time to communicate with each other and let us have more tacit understanding
i also saw some classmates play the phone or have a sleep in the classfoster success listen carefully in class take notes interact with teachers actively answer teachersquestions actively review after class and communicate with teachers when confronted with problems they do not understand。
to achieve our goalswe have to cooperate and share our ideas
this is very beneficial for our groups future study
only in this way can i achieve the goal that i want to get
well i think first important thing is language as in my group there are 2 chinese and 2 british and i am very helpful that they have good confidence even though we can not talk with them as much but i know if we try to start helping each other then it will be the best group in our whole session we have to overcome our weaknesses by supporting each other and thats what i want from everyone
some supervisors lead me to visit physics and electronic building make me familiar with some offices and function of rooms
as a project manager i will be more effective using this tools international business in my future jobs for example i worked in international project where teams were from differenent countrieshowever i did not have this tools international businessmoreover this course is helping me in not judge people from other countries without knowing first their culture
yes definitely
i am an introvert but the teacher needs a lot of interaction in class so i will try to get myself involved
i need to take care of everyone  s emotion and provide necessary help when they need8
in some specific classes such as the international business and management and marketing of technology tutors always give us true examples to help us understand the gist or specific terminologies
sometimes we can use some body language and make eye contact with the audience
i have become a relatively strong figure from the very slim body at the beginning all relying on my three years of persistence so persistence is the cornerstone of every successful personthe last point is also the key to success
i am sure to overcome these problems and finish my masters degree so that i can apply for a doctors degree
first of all when i first take notes i will write some things that i think are important in my notebook
the team should have a good leader so that heshe take the team in the correct direction
i think it may well actually i did not ask a question yet but i heard they answer other students question is good
well its style is what i expect
each line from the centre leads you into more depth on a particular theme
since it is one kind of learning students need to try understand something
for example asking them to sort it out withme or asking them for some advice
it is not a teamwork if some one only care about themselves the purpose of teamwork is to learn from each other and gather ideas and opinions from everyone
a mediumsized group of 45 people is ideal3 establish flexible group norms
because each persons level is different the work done or the progress of the work in a limited time is different
then i started thinking about what i did monday through sunday
in the course our supervision group had a deep discussion at first and then we agreed on one method quickly
they just want to help through other students not willing to think
in the marketing of technology the lecturer have showed us introduction of maketing maketing segmentation approaches to maketing research and branding they are all vital component of maketing
i am still working on public speaking i want to conquer the nervous
maybe i can be a leader of the team because i think i always have the ideal of the programme and i can organize the team members
yes i strongly think i can obey the principles when i am a msc student in york
it is better to not so manywords
selflearning can exercise ones ability to arrange time
but this may cause our english to progress slowly
i would download the ppt of the class on vle before the class if can doit and before the class i would preview it check these word that i didn  tknown and search these theories that i don  t understand
i may forget some little things
it is fundamental that we who are involve incollaborative learning must read or we have experience about the topic
everything is very good
yesi will try my best to follow the rules
its different in group work which we can learn how to cooperate with other members
this also taught me the ability to find key factors and integrate data
after that l find the usual way to take the notes does not work for me which becomes more timeconsuming and hard to find out the logic among the notes l take and l fail to remember the key info without the picture in my mindas to show the level of the significance of the notes l put the main topic in the map in the order from the most important to the normal for each course
for example he would like to use some humour languages and do some interesting gestures in class which i have never seen in chinese classes
no doubt teamwork is important no one can do the works by himself
once i got up in the morning and decided to go to the library to study
and when i review the lecture i will organized all my notes on another notebook with the power point in the class
i do like the style of this class changing different teachers for every class and i will look forward to studying with different tutorpersonal effectiveness and masterclasses the course is taught by bidyut and as i have mentioned before i like bidyuts pace of teaching
i think is ok i do not change a lot now in my study
when you encounter problems you dont understand ask for help in time
therefore no engineering project can violate the principle which i fully abide by
l have known how to support in a group and how to behave with different people as there is a common objective to reach
think the ‘ promote public awareness and understanding  is hard to do
the teachers here will use slides which contain knowledge points extracurricular information and some useful materials to let us understand the content of the class4
and then based on the knowledge i have learned before i will do this academic work step by step by these knowledge
now i always go to the physical and online library to find the relative study materials to help to understand the theories that delivered by lectures in classes but i seldom to find more information proactively before8
all the theacher are friendly and have interact with us which make class atmosphere more active and interesting
i learned the law of emthe strategic managementcultural differencesmanagementmarketing of technology and some characteristics of different country from the lectures
i think it might be a good way for mei usually use two pens with different colours to mark the key points the red one is for the most significant points the black curve is for relatively important points and black beeline is for the general significance
i really enjoy the class because teachers would respect the thoughts of students and the process of discussion in my supervision group is very meaningful for me
im sure i can understand my notes the i think it can help me to remember the knowledge when i need
yorks teaching content is close to practice
just like the answer to the first question i think every teacher has met this standard
in my group they have a lot of interesting idea that is very good
in my first degree there is no seminar
in that case we can consider a question from different ways
they will listen carefully and give very detailed answersand if i still do not understand they will explain further which i think is very good
i think good time management is very important for me to be a distinction grade student
i am quite confident to say i do it seriously with rules and requirements
so in the process of doing enterprise work i encountered many difficulties
yeswe can as a studentwe should have some responsibilities we have to follow during msc taught program so after graduation we can implement all ethical principles in our practical life during masters we can work on these principles likegive acknowledgement to other authors work stay away from professional misconductbehave well with all colleaguesthey should give due weight to all laws facts and publication guidancealways act responsibly and honorably and stand with dignityalways abide university laws and regulationeffectively advance public awareness and comprehension of the effect and advantages of engineering accomplishmentsduring submitting of reports we have to make sure all data is confidential and you have enough evidence to proof your research workas a engineer managerwhen we are working for a company then make sure our all work in favor of company be reliable and honest with the company we have to make sure to respect rights and reputation of other companies and individuals so it will not effect company reputationalways take serious steps in case of copyrights infringement or report improper influencewe have to obey all laws and regulation and make sure our work is according to that laws and in favour of public interestwe have to make sure the security of confidential documents and data protection of companymoreoverengineers need to understand they have to use their understandings and knowledge wisely and effectively with care
first i think we should have a consensus goal for the group tasksecond do a good job in strategic planning for each missionthird clear assignment of tasks
the carefully prepared slides the video link related to subject the recommended reading bibliography
i believe in the power of unityabout the content of the international businessi think johns analysis of cultural differences has changed my original view about this topici used to think culture difference is just the locals habit and custombut i know it is a shallow ideaafter learning the lectures and doing my activities i found there are many reasons result in the difference such as power distance longterm orientationthese were ideas i had never thought of before
normally it is impossible that all the students attend the lecture are in the same level therefore it is always difficult to find a appropriate teaching rate which is suitable for every student
i usually like to play basketball
for this sudden event i put aside the study began to take a bath andgave myself makeup changed clothes and so on
due todifferent cultural differences different team members will have different waysof thinking
when we planed to assign some tasks to individuals there might be disagreements among us
before beginning an assignment it is best to define goals and objectives tisane time2
only a clear division of labor willmake the team work in orderfinally a positive work attitude
sometimes i can not understand contents from tutors lesson however those knowledges would be understand very well as long as i read related reports
furthermore i was pretty enjoy when teacher have interact with us
i have spent a very significative two months at the university of york
i am worried that i will not be fully integrated into my professional courses because of the small number of courses
i have learned a lot from our collaborative learning in the course of enterprisefirstly collaborative learning refers to the group of students complete the task together and there is a clear division of responsible mutual learning
every times he talks in the class with teacher are attractive
i believe i can perform well in the year ahead if i study harder than the others
in the end my parents did the decision
it  s also a big problem to leave your work to the last minute
and another thing i have to say is that all lecturers are largely responsible for each lecture
it is more interesting than what i experienced in the past
theknowledge points that need to be learned and practiced are in powerpointpresentations and labscripts so there is no special needs to take notes
i started knowing no one and now im very good friends with people from my class and from my flat at student castle
and i think to work hard teamwork and creation are essential factors for the success
maybe because the york store is closed too early maybe because i am not familiar with the entertainment venues here
and there will always be strong signals before the lecturers move to next point which can help us to follow
from my work experience i know anystudy opportunity should be cherished because you do not have much free time tostudy something you like when you begin to work
we need to complete this study beforethe formal course which can greatly improve our independent learning ability10
i really hope myself to become a distinction grade student although its not very easy
i felt that my voice is not clear enough and thespeed of speech was not appropriate which made me realize that i still had alot of room for improvement
there are some differences between my first degree and the msc in em at york 1i need to do more reading in the current major at york
all in all i should tell myself that i am a student now i should focus on my study and have a diligent attitude for my academic work
yes the ways of courses are divided into different part such as lecture workshop seminar and so on in some part i will have lots of opportunity to interact with classmates and masters
i think this trait is valuable when trying to absorb as much useful and accurate knowledge as possible
use the quotation and paraphrase properly and don  t forget to put the reference everything will be good
i often write down on the notes what i think i must write down
then the two teachers who taught law were too fast to understandprofessor jis voice is the loudest and i can even hear him in the back row
for example i would like to draw a start in front of the sentence that i think is important
i am sure in the future modules especially in the final project we have to work collaboratively within a team and we have to work collectively with all attributes which all individuals have right now
it is not an easy task to listen to the class but everyone has not given up because of difficulties or actively participates and interacts with the teacher
sometimes i just have done the work by myself without communicate with my former group member
because everyone can not reach a consensus all the time
we have to keep positive attitude to learning；establishing the goals becoming motivated when we know exactly what is expected and therefore achieve more
therefore i need more practices after class
therefore in the lecture the lecturerdoes not need too many humorous ways to explain but only needs to discuss whatis easily ignored in some mistakesin theoryas said before it is boring so it depends on the lecturer of logical thinkingand interesting discussion to enhance the enthusiasm of the class
sometimes i think i do not make full use of the fragmented time which means i always play video games and watch tv shows between two planned projects
sharing ideas is a necessary factor because the biggest advantage of group learning is that we can get in touch with different ideas and things can get unexpected inspiration thus enriching our achievements and can also make up for personal mistakes
a successful collaborative learning should have members with the same goal toward which all of the team members are working together
we can know about the next session and task for next week
its also dependent on the amount of work the students do outside of the lecture
good time management 9 testing by the report 10 more social activity
with only one perspective could be difficult to solvethe problem
neither
whether the personarguments are reliable or not
this directly led to the failure of some of the work or internships i have participated in or the quality of the final results would be decreased
i am so expected for the new programme
however at york university i didt seem to find such a rule and the students here are generally overweight
yes exactly
i ask myself to be morerigorous in the learning of each module and to be more careful when i completemy academic work
and china gives a long lunch break at noon
secondly everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses
the learning environment is really nice
in the uk assignments or papers are submitted to teachers in electronic archives whereas in china they are mostly submitted in printed form9in some classes some related theatrical performances and ppt presentations are required
this teaching method focuses on the students selfreflection ability
i dont have any concerns about dse courses everything just like i knew before
at the same time i learned a lot of new learning skills through some group activities and games
as astudent of the embedded wireless systems course the observed behaviors arediverse and the following are divided into two categories for analysisfor class discussions with engineeringmanagement courses most of them have a certain economic foundation
i like the teaching style
my groupmates can support me and make up my weakness and i can lead them to great work
there may be arguments between people with strong personality while others do not always express opinions
therefore i hope i could use some abbreviations and graphics in some appropriate places to reduce the time to take notes and improve class efficiency
someone may be not active with the group work which can break the harmonious group atmosphere5
my heart isstill very tormented nowi dontwant to be a good student i am also trying to be a good student and planningmy time
for example i can scribble the records on white paper and then organize them in my notebook after class
i think its a good thing to have similarities between team members even the opposite is a happy thing
york university organizes too manyinteresting activities like bar party day trip and ball games which enrichour campus life and release study pressure
i believe that selfconfidence is the most important factor in promoting success
geographical difference9
we seem to have a lot of choices but we lack of experience and lack of courage to accept failure so we often stop and become more and more confused
as you knoweveryday i need to attend the class and read the reference books
my time in york has been a really good experience so far
ould be effect the working in the team
among them astatement respecting the privacy of others that i will guard against not forthe pursuit of efficiency again
but after the class when i read the reading materials i will take some notes that can help me to review the materials
and this course will teach us about the strategy in commercial
the tasks in college are all personal tasks which can be discussed with classmates
this is my bad mistake in lecture
my experience in yorkfirstly english is not our first language but it is not the reason not talking to english people
therefore the presentation of slides and the teachers are excellent
i will be a promoted equality person as well
this question is not suitable for our dse students to answer
term 1 end of week 5 log entry observation of academic behaviour in yourself you have now experienced 4 weeks worth of lectures what did you like about the lecture style of the lecturers be specific about each
the class is more interactive than before so i am rarely distraction in the class
to be honest i was so confused before i come here
two of my team members have several years of work experience which i admirei think their strengths are polite and modest and the background of professional knowledge is strong
another one would be not getting enough sleep
i think most of my teachers are more clear in teaching and can understand the teachers meaning very well
i think that in collaborative learning we should learn from each others strengths give full play to the advantages of each member and respect and understand each other
i also have some shortcomings in my study skills
occasionally i participate in activities organized by the school
i think i need some time to be familiar with them to know their advantages and weakness so that i can know how can they help me to achieve my study goals for the programme
law for engineering managementsometimes i cant understandmarketing of technologyi always can understand in this areamanagement of technoloythis lecture is good in this areainternational businessthis lecture is good in this areaenterprisei think the scope and specification of this lecture are clearstrategy managementi think the lecture did well in this areamsc personal effectiveness and masterclassesthe lecture is good in this area
i will show my feeling and differences below1
he is more seriousbut he uses examples which help a lot to learn
and then hell have the answerand he can make sure the student gets the answer at the end
whenever i go to the festival i always like to have friends and classmates get together to eat and entertain
in fact after coming to york i gradually realized the importance of selfdirected learning
i got up at 700 every day to go to the classroom to study english and then went to the gym after the end of the day taking a break and went back to the classroom to review the content of the course of the day which makes me feel a sense of accomplish at the same time the relationship between my friends and me became more intimate when they have troubles in learning compared to the previous time i said that i do not know either i could help them to solve the problem
with the help of the facility we all can hear clearly
this time i didthe things very different
sometimesim a bit stubbornperfectionistand it is hard for to make a choice especially when there are two things to chooseit is very difficult
what i have expected before was that most of us focus on class well and give heated discussion when lecturer asks us to do it on the basis of the prepreparation
only by thinking we can strengthen what we have learned
i have gained some insights in the group work
i think the most important thing in my presentation is interact such as eye contact and ask some question
in my opinion i must be able to do well academically and i am still a little bit confident
and then he gave us the answer that big rocks represent the most important things followed by little rocks and sand and if we put big rocks in it we can put little rocks and sand in it
from my perspective it is really helpful but also very difficult to get the balance of the humor between serious
i do learn from the lecturer that when we give a talk all we have to do is to try our best to improve our audiences engagement
i think the activity that can join is to exchange our group frequently can let us learn the advantage of different person
generally i feel expectations were set fairly well
and i used to couldnt engage in class so i waste a lot of time during high school
in my undergraduate studying i just need to learn much knowledge but need not put this into practice
i think that such learning methods and habits will be of great help to successin terms of hindering success i believe that incorrect time management can hinder success
besides i can learn how to make good slides and show my topic clearly
in the beginning of this term i wrote all the things i want to learn and what i want to do in the paper
he helps me to move from onepoint to another easilyjoanna north lectures flows logically
divergent opinions that could not be able to find a balance or meeting pointwide communication gap
and i am gradually taking part in the interaction which i enjoyed very much
my ability to take notes in class is wise
some of them which i dont understand i will review it with slides and online materials then i will remember what i have writteni think i still need to improve my english listening skills and grasp more academic terms to help me understand lectures well
i am very happy with the induction programespecially the friendly teachersi used to think that the teachers were seriousbut the induction program changed my viewthe program did changed my thinking about it
because his objectives are clear andeach one is related with another
in the opposite view is everything going to be all right
deal with emotional problems and any interpersonal problems that arise at any time and then continue to work hard
professor always give us some reading list
eye contract 3
last but not least plan and arrange my own time reasonably
being able to interrogate problems challenge bias spot gaps and devise flexible imaginative solutions will set you apart and shape your own personal development
so i really expect next friday
this is the forth week of our autumn term that means our term near to the half
however some lectures are given by different lectures which sometimes make me a bit confused
occasionally i may have doubts or disagree with the lecturer but as the lecturer explains the knowledge i will agree with the lecturer or understand another aspect more
learn to abbreviate
some people are responsible for coordinating
i think there are lots of way to help me
regular meetings can make groupmates be familiar with each other which can make work fluently3
the afternoon sessions let me get value experience from the alumnus the activity of making tower is really helpful which lets me have a good chance to communicate and work with my group
i really want to be a distinction grade student and i also want to study hard for this goal
i think that communicating with local students in the future can better let us learn different ideas
now i can already take notes easily and i can understand the notes when i review
the lectures that he teaches us are in deep scope
i think this is a good way
by collaborating with my group mates i canpresent my thoughts and others can provide me with some suggestions for improvementor point out something that goes wrong for me
additionally i found a temporary job that i  m happy with also i  m started to carry on my overall health
yes every lecturer encouraged students to tell their ideas and opinions
i did realize that i need more theoretical knowledge to arm and improve myself
in accuracy and rigor i didnt handle things with care
nervous about language
first language barriers
each group should have a leader and it will be the person who has strongest leadership
in our group if someone has different opinions our group would discuss this issue and solve this divergence
our current goal is to hope to get a degree smoothly so we will develop what we need to do every week and practice and improve it before the teams results are displayed
first of all our team comes from the same nationality
well i saw that all students are very cooperative specially chinese students most of my class is full of chinese students but at the same time i saw they are very kind and humblealways try to help their fellowsindians students are also very friendly and cooperative and they always look forward to help youmost amazing thing i saw students are not getting shy in doing any act in front of class which encourage me to speak up and start asking questions in front of whole class because this was the main fault in me i was not able to speak in front of people even i had good points but now i am getting used to these new thingsin the start i was expecting that here most students would be british but now i realize it doesnt matter the important thing is to learn with students about their culture about their values about their country and now i am feeling so much good even my masters is really fun for me with a lot of knowledge of world
i think we can have some small group to do some research project on or off campus
characteristics of mine which are keeping me back from achieving my goal
but i like to challenge myself
yesthere were lots of time for us to work with our group to make us learn the teamwork and get know each otherit is really makes me surprisedand i really enjoy the time to work with my team to design a product and build a towerwhich let me know the important of work together in our future study and work
that could create divisions
some students cant reasonably distinguish between learning and entertainment time spend most of their time on entertainment and often leave the learning task before the deadline which makes learning very passive
however most ofthe lecture requires a report and there are several reports are required to behand out after the vacation
compared with my first degree there are not exams but reports or case study during final week which means i not only need to reflect slides from tutors but also check and read masses of books journals or reports
the main differences between my undergraduate studies andthe msc are1 research focus in my undergraduate studies it was morea technical approach more than research
first he would show us what we will learn in this lesson
in the lectures i have observedthe lecturerss definition about what it is they were going to talk about were very clear and easy to followthey had a good connection between two different parts in their presentationsthese good points are helpful for me to prepare my future presentation
i think this is very helpful in understanding and mastering the content of the course and it can also cause an interest in learning and thinking
in the future by considering every problems which we have faced in our group firstly i will use suitable communication skills to solve any potential problems and conflicts inside the group then we will achieve a common opinion
i want to be a distinctiongrade student but i am worry about my academic writing
anyone is eager to be a good person and i am no exceptionbased on the chinese traditional concept almost all parents and teachersbelieve that children with good grades are more worth being regarded withspecial respect
i think individual ability is very important to a person and people can be respected if he or she is distinguished in some fields
i think the lecturer defined well by using their slides and explain the knowledge in detail
i could have learned more things but in order to complete tasks more quickly i ignored many knowledge points that could be further learned2
we use the expertise and knowledge that we have learned for school toapply work and life in the future
in the test i am a esfj
many lectures are well designed and clearly express the content of the lecturelecturers introduce one topic into another naturally and logically
i have a good example here in the science lab fiveyear students play different roles including team leaders reporters journalists and inspectors
in the process we cooperated and interacted with each other very well which made us succeed to build a tall paper towel
however i think oriental food is more delicious
i think in the beginning stage we can allocate some different works and then group members can choose the mission they think they will good at its good for us to play our strength and improve work efficiency
some are responsible for implementing someone responsible for creativity
thats one of the differences that i want to talk about
i expect a lot of work this year and rightly so
through the 3 day afternoon class i can make a clear plan to prepare for the week 2 of study and learn some basic learning skills
especially in the aspect of academic literature sources i often can not find corresponding academic data
for examplea team member did not complete his or her own tasks which affected the outcomeof the entire team work
in order to achieve our goals in the next three terms i want to be the person who can ease the atmosphere within the group
i am a person who does not take the initiative to communicate with others i also lack team spirit and leadership skills but in university of york i met very good team members
on this basis others are reluctant to do extra work and eventually fail to do the reverse3
i prefer morning sessions
and i used to think everyone would listen to the lecturers carefully and do some notes2
yeswe have the same opinion and they also use the notes
many negative behaviorscould happen and we hope that our team can make correctionsfor example david who often provides inspiration to groups based on his own experience
what do i need
another one is having enough body language this will help me to explain what i want to transfer more clearly
as is well known to us it is nearly impossible toget a distinction degree by passing one course or showing good behavior in a presentationwe need to make some detailed plans and finish them one by one on time
the good thing is that im trying to change thatanother unavoidable problem is that i will be homesick sometimes
second i like to play game although i am good at it
different types of personalites of different people may lead to conflicts but we can solve it and work smoothly
all of my teachers make them voice loud to make every one hear clearly and they have the engage with us and they make the notes
moreover these new words are generally important words and even some are keywords of headlineto be honest sometimes i could not understand my note when i review them
when i return to china after graduation i will also take rae as the standard
miao and zilin are good at expand our ideasand can understand others quickly
everyone needs to take responsibility for their tasks and get them done
all lectures are started with a little introduction speech with supporting slides sometimes there is also a speech about things that we had on previous lectures
teaching in this way is more intuitive than directly explaining the definition of the model
i dont know do my teachers use notes
i think that individuality is also an essential factor for successful collaborative learning everyone must bring something to the table in order to teach others within the group
sometimes there are too many words in one slide in some lecture ppts which would affect my focus on listening to the lecturer
because the next year we will write a lot of papper and that would help us to finish it
because this can help me collect more professional information when we talk with more people rather than just think some thing in a small circle then we can have a better learning result when we discuss with supervision group members
it is the most basic thing to ensure that every student can hear clearly
i dont think i do well academically yet iaspire to be an excellent studentyes who doesnt want to be a good studentithink the main problem that prevents me from being an excellent student is myenglish ability the way i communicate with people and time managementi haveproblems in english communication
firstly since i come from china the britain culture is really different from china and i also worry about my language and my course
i would also research these theories that i need in the assignmentin advancealthough i aspire to be a distinction gradestudent and try my best to achieve it sometime i still do something preventme from being a distinction grade studenti think i have a bad performance in myemotion control and management and that can prevent me from being adistinction grade student
one situation where this could be apparent is when i visit my mothers house either on the weekdays or the weekend as i find myself having to help around with the many house chores such as cleaning and help take care of family members and pets
in the future collaborative learning i will pay more attention to communication and cooperation with all members of the team and will continue to share and improve the learning style
the lecture of law and management of tech is a little difficult for me because there are many new words
i wrote something teacher said but not in the powerpoint
yes i like it more than the syle in the past
i am also pleased that the depth of learning seems like it will meet my ambitions for this year
the first term of my master course has begun for more than one month
the most important thing is a serious and responsible attitude
i think that the lack of good english in team learning has affected the smooth progress of the work
i cant balance my study and life very well
noel is quite helpful since i have a lot of questions in this field
everyone has a different personality
finally everybodysits in the same bench in each lecturei expected thatstudents only speak english before and after the lectures and everyone attendedit without distraction
firstly i may misled otherswhen we solved some mathematical problems
here the independent study is more important because here students are more free to chose what they are really interested
because everyone has different ideas when dealing with the same problem there will be great differences in working methods and logical thinking
it usually contains some basic theory and simple example to make students easy to catch up with what the lecturer is talking about
and i used software similar to facebook during class i will ban this behavior in the futureif i violate the ethical principles i will take the initiative to admit mistakes and positive corrections to the company or school
the teacher told us before that we should focus on the key points in reading an article and do not translate it word by word
also practice make the perfect i think the more presentation i give in front of the audience the more confident i will be
providing useful idea while discussion
i will enrich my body language and make more eye contact with my audience
for example bidyut is an extremely patient lecturer he wants all of us can understand what he says and he wants to make sure everyone has already engaged in the course when he finished one slide he always ask us that it is make sense
in collaborative learning only when you are responsible for the parts which you can handled better than others can you accomplish better
it will be a great honor for me to be a distinction grade student
i think the most useful is the activity of developing a product with a few images
the common goals and devoting skillas a group we need to discuss and make a common goals
this welcome week is a great experience for me i can have a relatively comprehensive understanding about the department of electronic engineering and my major engineering management
i am not sure because the class does not start
however for the current postgraduate courses as far as this semester is concerned i have seven different aspects of course knowledge to learn which is undoubtedly more stressful than before
i think unity is very important to a group and everyone has to devote to a group intially
i like jokes and interesting things
in the behavior in class i think some students not only listen carefully but also actively ask and discuss with the teacher when they dont understand the questions and take notes when they hear important contentsi think this is a very efficient learning behavior in class so i think such students will succeed
in our activities i think this is able to expand my idea
i think im able to understand my own notes when i review them because the understandability level of my notes suits me well
first the teacher will pay great attention to the logical structure in class and will enumerate a large number of data and authoritative information to support the content and structure of the class
first of all mutual respect is an important premise
after the basic course knowledge she also invited the management companys managers to participate in our classroom
they are excellent and full of intelligence i think the strength is all of us are creative and the weakness may be we have too much ideasbut we can not decide the final one until the challenge was finish
unlike usthere is a lack of knowledge in this area
and they are very patient for all the students even if they are asking questions in the class
in the class i can write down and know about knowledge and what i need to do after class
strengthen communication plan and supervise each other in advance to ensure the team work is completedi think we should accept cultural diversity and accept different ideas
i dont know
1the key points of the lectures are different
msc engineering management needs to know about effective use of technology
i can not waste my parents  money and my owntime
however never too old to learn keepthe curiosity and the spirit you want to know
my observation of the behavior of students in my class could be summarized as follows1
they engaged with our eyetoeye very much during lecture which helped us keep focusing on the lecture
when i started my research regarding my masters studies universities masters options cities etc i always thought that this is a very importnt stage is a base foundation on which i can build my professional career
after some brief introduction of the course are given i am not worry about my course anymoredue to the familiar course can be found
but lack of confidence is the first thing that holds a person back from growing
i think it must be timebecause everyone in the team has different things to do and different calendarssometimes it is hard to get together to have meetings
about 90
i do not have much work experience so i think i have never disobeyed the rae ehical principles
it is also very reasonable to connect between different courseware
whats more they are very cooperative and friendly which makes our task finished smoothly
and i expected a great relationship with my classmate before
besides i need to let go of my burden and communicate with my foreign friends
international business the teacher is very interested in the class although sometimes the classroom rhythm is too fast often elaborated feeling a little jump the overall feeling is goodmanagement and marketing of technology the lecturer is very logical to divide the course into different modules and progress from shallow to deeplaw for engineering management some lecturers are more rigorous and academic and some lecturers are more humorousmsc personal effectiveness and masterclasses the lecturer is very funny and uses a lot of body languagestrategy management for em use reallife cases and funny language with pizza rolls and chocolate as a reward
in terms of the life at york i may not be able to adapt to live alone at first but with the help of my friends and the kindness of strangers i gradually adapted to the life herethe final formal education was undergraduate
going from the behaviours mentioned above the behaviour that will generate the most success would be the students behaviour to ask questions to the lecturers as this shows that the student wants to not only learn the current material but to go beyond what was presented at the lectures
i think everyone should be responsible for their own parts which makes the team work more efficiently
now i prefer to ask questions by email to my lectures but i always asked lectures after class as soon as possible for they didn  t check email very often before
i am not worried about this year because i am very much looking forward to it
besides every lecturer always makes sure that we can hear himher
through the mutual support of the members members could fully interact and share with each other stimulate the ability and potential of the team members better understand themselves and others
i like this kind of interaction that can improve my ability of communication
while i have a few opportunities to experience it in the past education pattern
i think that there is too much information compressedwithin the lectures
however the personal professional practioner lectures were to a much larger audience than i had anticipated as i did not realise that they were shared between all of the taught msc courses offered by the electronic engineering department
as an engineering student i have an obligation to follow these guidelinesin fact as a beginner of ethicalstatements i dare not guarantee that i will not violate every rule in thestatement
i hope that i also can have more creative thinking
everyone has different personalities and abilities
due to individual differences everyone can find their own comparative advantage
when i have free time i would like to lie in bed and watch tv play games or get together with friends and go to some parties
one of the thing i have learned with collaborativelearning is that nothing is impossible when we work in group
as for all the teachers have their own teaching styles or the presentation styles they give me some different feelings on their class but all the lectures are very well
we will continually modify the program constantly improve the content of the work and strive to achieve the best results
everyone need to have contribution to the group
the college where i stay also has some pc rooms which i can use when i am pretty much tired to walk all the way to the library7
for the class of management of technology most of the content so far is technology demonstration and presentation
every teacher  s lectures are perfect and the prepared slides are also very clear and easy to understand
im not sure that i really came in with any expectations per say
the activity that all the group members work together to build a paper tower is the most helpful onei think the two team activities should be on the same day
when giving a speech you can be more involved in the speech and bring your passion to the audience
i believe that i have a good grasp of ethical standards and that i have not violated any moral and ethical issues
they divide the whole module into different parts to train and gradually improve it through previous teaching experience so i believe that the module teaching part is relatively mature
teachers often ask questions to get our feedback
i like the feeling of knowing about different thoughts and i hope that i can improve my english skill so that i can express my opinions in the class like some excellent students
the behaviour that will bring hindrance will be the student who sleeps as this appears to be a waste of everyones time himself included
b taught the clean wastewater and plastic companyi really like this way to engage students set by set students can think more deeply in the different situation
and in enterprise course i truly experienced how to be a entrepreneur which really needs hardworking5
i think successful collaborative learning requires people devote to assignments initially and proactively and they have to work harmoniously without conflicts
for example in china the focus of educationis on the examination students just need to do the exercises repeatedly andjust need to learn what tutor teaching to us most of the information is rigidso in china student just need to do the exercises hard then they can have a goodmark
when i was in china i also give some guest lecture at the university
and macgregor jt 1992
in this semester i need to study three professional courses and one supplementary course
i think the activities of the induction programme should be arranged in the morning
i think our lectures were so great except law for emour course i think should more focus on international business
there is no problem with the logic of the lecture
this is a step up
i could collect data and evidence as soon as possible but i can not analyse and union then very well so i learnt some write skills including grammar structure reference etc
i like this way as it brings strangpeople together and we live in the same city in a better way
in the bottom section is my own narrative of all classroom content
after all work in the future is teamwork so leading and communicating will be a big challenge
in group work i try to share my ideaand advise to my group mates
the third problem is that i found it isreally hard to complete an assignment especially the referencing part but i wouldwork hard on this part
whatever i will try my best to keep the benefit of the shareholders as well as the public benefit
i think i can keep these principles as a warning
i think group work is very important in msc courses
my undergraduate major is mechanical engineering
third is the passion
law for engineering management has the least amount of design as each lecture is presented by a different lawyer on a different topic of lawall lecturers for their modules use humor to help ease tension with a certain topic and to help the student engage with the lecturer when they ask a question during a lecture
in the uk you  ll cultivate your skills from day one with the chance to develop a thorough understanding of professional terminologies such as business english
i didnt get a chance to discuss with my group
they will all use slides to help them make logic clear and also sometimes interesting slides help their lectures become more humour
the last thing is using right volume this is to make sure all the audience can hear what i am saying
in my view i think the lecturer should be defined some contents which are meaningful simple
different students have different thinksome students can consider the real condition of projectothers ignore feasibility of their idea
i am very satisfied with the current teaching style
every lecture taught a lot of knowledge point tutor classified them very well
i understand that even if i dont have a clear plan for my career i shouldnt waste time
i spend more time in the class and i do not need to spend time after class but in uk i need to spend time after class4
no surprises just confirmation that i have chosen the right course for me
my previous major required many programming exercises including some repetitive process of writing programs
it is a very significant thing i need to know
dr russell poldrack saidthat pleasurebased habits are harder to break
so the first step i guess is the time not enough
pressure i feel much more pressure and cant sleep very well in the msc which rarely happened in my first degree7
there are two challengesfirstly engineering manager needs to keep learning new thingssecondly engineering manager also needs to obey rules from the company and do not leak information to others
the advantage is that we have the same culture and thinking mode that is conducive to our usual communication
i was prettyconfident about myself at that time so i took the position and start torunning the things on daily bases
sometimes our meetings deviatefrom the meeting theme and our plan
6different selflearning time
to be honest when i make my notes in the lecture the biggest challenge for me is to keep the balance of listening and writing
i think there are many differences between my last education and msc in em at york
it is clear about they were going to talk about
everyone had there own strengths for instance siyang and jizun were really smart and innovative they can always thought different methods and ideas about our tasksshuai is careful and he usually add some important suggestions during our program tianyu is activity and social he can help us to finish our communication that we need
as an old saying goes ‘ he that lies down with dogs must rise up with flea
everything else is worth learning
the lecturers also use the visual aids like videos to play in a short time minidramas as assignments for groups to do in the platform
during this class some basic tools function will be showed and some skills such as presentation and references have been showed
i found in our class there is one male who has brilliant speaking ability so that he answers questions frequently
the idea or theory are supported by correctevidence
so he resigned and came here even he is not at the age of a common student
i think it should be anxious to influence the quality of our teams entire project
i can learn more things through the observation of how others think about it and what extent their experience is various from mine which has a provoke impact on my future growth
if not i would ask the lecturer for help
i think some parts of me would really prevent me from being a distinction grade student
but i feel confident in my study process and i believe inmy ability to develop new skills and i  m selflearner
so wecan see the problem or issue from different perspectives
and in my bachelor degree if students want to raise a question or give an opinion they cant interrupt the teacher at any time as their wish3independentstudy skill at here the lecturers will allocate a reading list to there students
as to opinion on priority some of them prefer to do something urgent first while someone like to do something important first
on the other hand sometimes if we have a course during noon i will be a little sleepy and i need a short break after lunch
i think its important to use the slides and prepare notes
i am quite an independent person which means i can handle a lot of things by myself such as going shopping alone taking part in the activities freely that i am interested in and cooking meals which is a piece of cake for me
it was good to know more about my course mates during the collaborative learning
i feel that we need to understand each others english level and each others strengths and weaknesses know what each person is best at so that we can reasonably find the positioning of each member so as to make a clear division of labor and do the best
i hope i can be more strict with myself
a lot of times it just looks like group work but its not really collaborative learning
we should cooperate with each other otherwise we can not finish our task well
i will try my best to work to these principles during my taught msc and my working life as an engineering manager
although my english is not good enough i want to help toothers to let everyone got the best grade
for instance i usually use red color when i have different opinion or confusion and write my own opinion near this sentences
for example when we attend the international business when tutor told us the culture differences or something which connected to capitalism some true stories and data or figures combined with citation in the slides will be showed to us
as a result we can learn from each other in the process of team work
if i cant manage my time i cant arrange my life and study
sometimes people wants to be lazy and i am no exception like it will be a long time to hand out my assignment or i just don not want to study sometimes
and i can answer i am a taiwanese and my nationality is taiwan
he looks very sick
and i also do not like reviewing which let me have to get a big task of organizing all the notes in a short time before assessment
of course in this case i will also start thinking about how the solution can solve the above problem faster and better
the teachers curriculum design is very reasonable the course content is also divided into different parts from the simple definition to the later case analysis the course rhythm is very reasonable
it means that the members of team can come up different ideas which can cultivate critical thinking
and i can acquire more knowledge if i finish homework efficiently
sometimes teamwork can be very successful but sometimes teamwork can be an obstacle in completing a task mainly because there are members in the team who dont work together and everyone pushes away from each others tasks and they dont care about the teams things
because i already learned in york one year i believe that i could adept to the teaching mode here well but at the same time i should face the corresponding pressure well
different assessment methods8
i think every lecturer is very serious about their lecture
the good behaviours are prereading the course slides and going to the classroom early before the class begin
however in some countries especially the countries whose bureaucracy is serious businessmen have to send bribes to the people have power
at the end of the class i would take time to sort out the notes and represent them on blank a4 paper through classification and key notes
sometimes i can not hear the local people speaking clearly the weather as well as food is also different than before
after becoming a graduate student at universityof york i have made great changes to the way i study
in china the taxi is easy to get and the bus usuallycome on time and fast
inaddition i will prepare myself for future problems which i might meet in myfuture study
the key point of collaborative learning is to be modest
as an engineering student in the uk i will definitely abide by raes requirements and standards during this period
to be honest i enjoy to take notes whether in study or in life which could let me have a clear planning and maximize the use of time
for example people here prefer to eat fish and chips
both classes mentioned that life in addition to boring learning there should be appropriate play to balance work and life
thirdly i did not activelyestablish communication with the teachers although the teachers were veryfriendly and willing to answer professional questions for us and encouraged usto do so
more importantly due to the influence of different cultural backgrounds foreigners are really brave to interrupt teachers and ask questions but from chinese culture we should respect our teachers and raise our questiones and communicate with our teacher individually after class
i think this is a very good phenomenon indicating that everyone is very diligent in learning
in addition we can look the slides by pcipad during lesson when we set in the back row
i hope the lecturers can take down some important notes on the blackboard
be able to admit your mistakes and discover the strengths of others
there should be such a phenomenon in many young people
when it comes to workshop i personally enjoy it
and there are more temptations in the computer for example some breaking news or notifications from social media will easily draw your attention
in the future i will also experience a lot of presentations
however there is almost no such kind of assignments as the course of enterprise that need to be completed by groups
my professor dictated to us most of the time
after classes when i review the notebook i found it is hard to understand what i want to say for the courses
therefore i try to get out the most of the classes and get the most important points of each lecturenow i try to organise myself with different color pens so i can reflect different importances and making things more important than others
i really enjoy this kind of study style about our essays and our teamwork
but it is can not be denied that there is still plenty of weakness in my study1
argument2
i felt like very small amount of the induction program was new to me
i contact the ambassador in the first place and find out thesituation was not as bad as people thought but i failed to calm our team
the quality of interaction influences collaborative learning
induction programme was very interesting
we should learn to how to absorb otherss advantages and share what we have possessed to our group membersi think its very important to communicate with each other and spare no efforts to the work of group to get the target and destination of the group
besides that i think oneof my action on my group meeting also have some bad effect on the academic
i have neverstudied this course before
besides there is no homework in china during the holiday so i need to prepare for the exam homework next year in york
when give a talk i hope to be confident enough to have my eye contact with the audiences
because people may have different views about some part of the task since everyone has a different growing environment and character someone are used to do one task at one time while others may prefer to do different tasks at the same time people may choose different time to start their work
what impressed me most was the international business course i mentioned several times before
we will improve us together by collaborative learning
but ive also heard about some famous notetaking methods like cornell notes but i feel that what suits me is the most correct one
so i improve the method in which i add more references and my own view to my notes in this way i can find key information on time and received more useful informationalthough there are many hardships during my work for example it is disable for me to understand some models and notes during the lesson i am improving constantly during the 7 weeks and i am confidence i can be better during every lesson and homework
when you start working on a topic you should divide your roles individually so that everyone in the team gets to work on specific topic
the reason is that in my opinion i still have time to modify but even though i have not made too many changes
practice the pronunciation and try to be familiar with your draft then you can improve other aspects such as make eye contact and use some humor to transfer atmosphere
i think be outgoing and always show youropinions in your team can foster scuess
mutual respect is much better than mutual dissatisfactioni think it is also important to learn to understand others
they know very well what they say and can teach us very easily
this is only one example that i will be nonproductive because sometimes i am lazy
very great
in my supervision groupthere are three male and three femalealthough we came from different placespeople are very friendly and outgoing
so when the lectures began i expected that all the other students have simmilar beliefs and commitment with the studies
dr jo north use the ‘ industry40   as the title of the ppt so she introduces background definitionand some applications of the fourth industrial revolution in that class
understand the final purpose and meaning of your collaboration4
we will discuss how to put swot analysis into our business model to help us better understand and deploy our marketing strategy
or maybe is simply because i still haven  t graspedthe essence of this subject
firstlyi feel that there is a language barrier between us because i have 2 british people 4 of them are chinese and we can reduce it just by speaking english so i am trying and i hope they will also try to remove this barrier between us the amazing thing by working as a team it will enhance our vision about something because everyone has its own way of thinking so after working as a team we have opportunity to learn everything on different aspects thereforeworking as a team effects me positively and i hope to learn something amazing this whole year
we master our own learning direction master our research direction control our time and manage ourselves
the chinese members comes up somenames that are related to the functions of our business while our spanish memberthink of a literary name that kas a relationship with the city and ourbusinesssecond i found that group members have manydifferent skills can make up for the shortcomings of others
therefore i really want professors can add more activities related with group that will be fun
finally it caused that i spent 45 minutes on video watching and entertaining instead of finishing some homework and doing some further research that is a kind of time wastingi realized this kind of bad habits could decrease my efficiency and ever created some negative consequences
for example after setting usagenda i can set up when i need to finish my task when i need to do exerciseand when i need to go to bed
maybe they have their own plan about study and life in the uk and just do not want to share with others too muchthe way dr john taught in class international business is really surprise mehe usually used session 1 to outline some of the main issues and session 2 for group work
what we are exposed to is no longer the cold knowledge but the things that actually appear around us
yes i am aspire to be a distinction grade student
since then i havebegun to pay attention to my problem and slowly correct it
i really think my classmates all have the strong ability and the atmosphere on the class is quite good
a leader is someone who can give a good suggestion and give the the team a good direction in case of disagreement or even motivation quarrel
i believe i will work to these principle in the future
i found that students are very creative and imaginative and are enthusiastic about learning
i f that does not work i will need to focus more in my main target which is university by reducing the time given to everything else
in addition the majority of our class will be recorded and published on the internet which is convenient for us to download and watch again
they are good designed talkingabout the way they are presented and delivered
lowefficiency in the group work
there are differences in understanding and answering questions which may affect communication with the tutor
i think that all teachers can do basic and clear communication of knowledge of which i like john of international business and joanna of strategy management the most
my partners are very nice and clever they also can find more useful ways to solve problems
in some situations i might be careless but i willtry to fix this behavior and correct my wrongs
in my academic work it couldbe separated into two parts
after all the preparatory courses i read before are mainly related to language and i dont have much professional knowledge so i can deal with it well
it is very important for us to give a talk we can make some notes but we cant read it we need to practice more to make it fluency
sure a clear lecture is very important for audience thus clear voice and ppt is necessary
in this way i can not only improve my english but also better understand the culture of other countries
in the past time i usually take notes by writing the everything in the board or slides
thirdly after the course i think i didn  t spend enough time on the courses
yesi am looking forward to learning more useful academic knowledge and put it into my future career
the most important is interesting and funny
in the course strategic management for engineering management dr jo north recommended us to read the book the fourth industrial revolution which describe how the revolution will change our lives
well during my masters i learned one thing is to learn by reflection on past actions
everyone has execution
most lecturers use tools such as powerpoint to help their audience understand
i do appreciate noel and bidyut always reply my email as soon as possible and their email do solve my problem sometimes they even give me some advice without ask
however i want to do my best to get the distinction
in lectures i learned how to link one part to the other part and i focus in their description
also by this it is easier for us to graspfor some of the lectures we have the preprinted notes so by that way we are able to easily annotate simultaneouslythey make the sessions really interactive and engaging so we are always indulged in learning new concepts out of each topicthe continuity is always maintained where a lecture always starts by refreshing or discussing a few points from the previous lecture
i just hope everything would go well in the future and i could learn a lot from msc engineering management
once，a student asks dr john issitt abouthow to communicate with a people from other culture and gives him two optionsafter dr john clearly understood the difference between the two options he answersthe question for the student and give reasons to him and shows us an exampleabout how to get along with foreign people
i think what i need to do is to go to the library so that i can concentrate my attention and keep learning
teaching style its simple and invariable in my first degree and its flexible in the msc5
now i am constantly trying to learn from this goali guess now not only me is confused about future career planning but also many undergraduates and graduate students are facing the same problem especially chinese students
but in uk the graduation rate is not as high as china
if you give something beyond your ability it will cause excessive pressure
in addition students who do not understand the content of the teachers lecture and do not ask questions or act negatively will not succeed
however people always live alone
i have never seen anyone of them with notes
well we had some teamwork and examines in the team i felt i am a strange people i can  t do anything only can do something really easy
there are so many things to learn in each course and we have few time todo it
i am afraid that i will learn less than others
i think tolerance can be the first and most important factor for successful collaborative learning
we wasted some time in that lecturebecause something went wrong with the audio equipment in the classroom and wehave to watch the ted video on our laptop finally
i have recognized that one of the biggest barrier for me to get distinction is the procastination
mentors and studentswhen i was an undergraduate student in china we had many teachers but we did not have our tutor
i think that i can not discriminate betweenmain ideas and details
the university is well equipped and the teachers are well prepared
help each other
for assessments goals were well explained and submission format information are given during the lecture
maybe we can change the form of the social event
the harder task is the same as the big stone the other simple is the same as the small stone and sand
secondly i need to do entire preparation to the lecture
in this process there would be some examples to ensure audience understand and know how to apply the knowledge
our lecturers always speak loudly to make us hear clearly
our usual language environment is different
including the members of different academic background language communication problems between member and member interpersonal skills are also different team leaders leadership also is not perfect that we need to have a certain psychological quality strong work coordination ability high compatibilitys language skills and leadership
the engineering management course is easier to understand7
the grading system here is also different from the place where i studied
i think that sofar this has been the most exciting part of this journey to learn new thingsto allow me to know myself better
it is helpful for my report writing5
with abundant examples and coordinated body language we can focus on the content of the teacher more quickly
i often see some of my classmates taking notes seriously during class
somepeople think that everyone with procrastination has a brain that is happy intime and is easily tempted by shortlived happiness
we take the midterm exam and the final exam
international business the tutor of international business has a very loud voice and he delivers knowledge with his voice ups and downs to highlight some key points we all can hear him clearly
john is very funny when we in his class he can draw our attention and use simple words to explain complex issuesi think it is very lucky to be his student
i always accumulate tasks until one second before handing in
all lecturers are very clear about setting learning outcomes for their lectures
this process was very hard for me because after finishing dinner i just want to take a relax that is even impossible to me to get back to learning when i found myself needs relax
without confidence the talk will be a trash
usually i would like to ask myself all sorts of possible questions to ensure that i absolutely understand this knowledge
third i will respect everyones ideas and listen carefully to their suggestions
it is easy for students to know the key points of the lectures
this course gives us a lot of practical knowledge
i think the way i listened to the lecture was not efficient and i should work it out to find a more efficient way like reviewing the videos of the lecture after the course
i always listen carefully and write down the key word such as 4p4c etc
in the internationalbusiness class john has a good sense of humor
professors are more friendly and they are worried that students must learn the courses vey well
they are using simple words instead of complicating things
read the reading materials 5 review the contents after classhinder success1
the induction programme helped me to meet and understand my groupmates
sometimes i also have the same answer or a better answer but i am nervous and shy about answering questions which are important factors that hinder my success
the management of technology can be difficult for me as i major in accounting during my undergraduate period there are some technical terms which i am not familiar with
may face many different temptations after work but i believe that keeping principles and beliefs can easily handle challenges
lecturers are will to answer every question
tutors always tells us the topic of todays speech and then starts to explain according to the ppt
the teaching method in the uk is more flexible focusing on guiding students to learn rather than like chinese teacher who prefer to tell us answer directly
summarized as follows 1
bidyut and noel are humourous to some degree and when we move to every small part in their slides they would like to do the summary of the last part and introduce the new partlaw for engineering management the lecture is special for changing teacher every class and every single class was well prepared by the professional lawyers
i really lived a very happy and fulfilling life in the past two months and i also gained a lot at the same time
but in my last university library would closed every night
i dont want to learn in a stressful environment
yesstudents are always active and concentrate on class
i think the biggest difference is the way of thinking
in this way he or she is motivatedand involved in the meeting
apart from this i was pleasantly surprised and positive moving forward with the programme
i will highlight the important information the lecturers mentioned in class i also will use pens in different colors to distinguish different levels of significations of notes i take pay more attention to the repeated knowledge in classgenerally speaking i am
this could lead to disaster in the group as too much responsibility on certain group members can produce inefficient results and stress
those of us who are returning york students generally have a good level of programming experience and familiarity with software packages used on the course matlab and pure data where others do not have such experience
dont review the contents
york university makes better use of the internet for resource contributions6
the slides are also very attractive and he often have eye contact with usnjs voice is clear and he is very patient when answering questions
im really excited to start
good preparation could also make some contributions to a collaborative learning
i think a distinction student should have the ability to discover and ask questions to collect and sort literature to create and clarify concepts to propose academic propositions or theoretical assumptions to design research processes and to be sensitive to academic frontiers and to develop academic imagination
and in account of the two big projections in the front it was comfortable to see the slides
the differences1timemanagement
i must be brave to speak out if i found problems
as a result it may delay for 10 minutes to 30 minutes to startthe work
i usually organize my days and weeks in advance
too much academic terms will let the listeners feel boring and be reluctant to pay attention to what you are talking aboutduring the time you give a talk jokes and little quiz can make a close connection with your audience and when you receive their feedback you will feel relaxed and enjoyable which is helpful to keep going
maybe someone never take out his or her idea3
timely to understand this is what i should avoid in my future study and life
for example the information is recorded asinfm
when i encounter difficulties i should find a solution to solve it rather than being upset and avoiding them
it has been five weeks since the postgraduate programme has commenced and it is now i could start feeling the pressure of the assignments and deadlines coming up
lacking of confidence in english speaking unless i encourage them to do so otherwise they would simply communicate in chinese
i am very happy to learn those useful skills
in terms of factors that are essential for successful collaborative learning i think they are trust each other help each other take personal responsibility and so on
i prefer to use hand writing to make notes ratherthan using electronic production
on the one hand the level of academic achievement on the other hand the development of personal qualities
first of all our team comes from different countries and there will be differences in thinking
but i know it is very bad and i will try to correct it and make my class time more efficientthe following is my methods to solve these problems above1
different diets the current daily diet will have steak pizza chicken wings fish and chips unlike the single chinese meal in the past4
i think i was adapting very quickly
the relationship between the students is more closely because the current group of projects in the study account for a large proportion but in the first degree all the work is basically done independently10
i need to dedicate more hours of studying and i mustunderstand very well each concept from each course so that i can apply in myfuture presentation and job
every one involved should contribute meaningfully and positively3
my team role preferences according to the questionnaire were teamworker and completerfinisher
i have been studying for graduate students for more than a month
i am not sure about their strengths and weaknesses now because im just getting to know them
it is a big challenge for me3
this is what i like very much because only in this way can i have a better understanding of engineering management course rather than just from books8
for example theleader
for instance in the business plan yuqin tells us some basic accounting rules and how to calculate them
some goodideas are born under such circumstances
some students actually answer questions because they dont understand or dont know how to express them in english
this is the key to the success of the team
however after finishing every single class the professional lawyers would like to do the conclusion part perfectly to help us deep understanding of the new knowledge
this will give you an insight of who is good in what and that can help you in the future2
however
it is very essential that everyone is working forward towards the same work and goal10
my study habits are not very good including the management of time and timely summing up the past and planning the future
due to the different cultural backgrounds and ways of thinking of team members sometimes we may have different opinions but we must listen carefully and respect each others opinions
the class should now have students from at least four different countries
everyone has their own area of expertise
also i will need to listen my team
its always a very efficient thing for everyone to do different things in a division of labor and finally to collect information
it is not easy for me because i do not know how to find the key word of my project
group study
the lecture is designed to be easier for us to follow what lecturer wants to tell us
is good to be in classrooms where multimedia devices are used to support this
these electronic products not only can influence our sleeping quality but also can distract us from our working or studyinghowever the fact is lazy is my final barrier
in the future work i may encounter someone from different country or different cultural background so i must learn early that how to tolerance and coordination and make more effective in team cooperation
for example some people only want to get a pass some people want to take a distinction and the inconsistent requirements for the same task may lead to unsuccessful collaborative learning
precisely the way i expected
interest can help me to keep learning such as i was interested in business plan i do all the things i can do in it2learning more skills about the person how to do well in teamworkingmaybe i will find some methods in google youtube etc3i prepare to learn a skill what my teammate lack of experience
we have to do the following：1
firstly i thought well maybe i just took a rest for 10 minutes then i will go back to work but after 10 minutes i still want to lie on my bed
after these four days introduction i have completely understood all necessary information about my course and the engineering electronic department
enlighten by the pros are much moreefficient than doing all the blind digging by oneself
i think the lecturers are very nice and knowledgeable as well as can explain things clearly
the previous professional price comparison emphasises the independent completion of the job so almost all of the assignments are done independently by one person including reports papers and programming
again unfortunately i missed out a lot of activities and some were a bit redundant
will help the mutual aid society to help everyone grow up well whether in learning or after school but help is to explain rather than replace him to complete some things this is a failure help
as the saying goes a soldier who doesnt want to be a general is not a good soldier so of course i aspire to be an excellent student
most of my usual learning content is to solve physical problems
teamwork doesnt mean you can do nothing during the process otherwise you will learn nothing from the course
after all our study is not only about knowledge but also culture
the last but not the least timemanagement is vital when facing lots of works to do
i do have concerns about the year ahead
most are designed pretty well
it can offers the chance to find a good idea
i was truly concerned about the programme before because my undergraduate major focuses on construction engineering while now my major belongs to the electronic department
yes i will follow these rules
so i need to learn it by some cases in this way i can understand it better after lecturers teachinganother critical research about our module is writing style and writing skills
at the same time he talked very carefully and communicated with his classmates at all times
i will check my self to avoid owning these weaknesses
polite culture
maybe it can make a collaboration more enjoyable
the building highest and stable building impress me most cause it needs us to corporate with teammates and we actually have done a great job to win the most creative and stable building
in order tokeep these guidelines in mind i will remind myself of some statements that ihave previously ignoredfor now i have some challenges there aretheoretical and respect the work of others without prejudice
it told us what we learned in the class
in addition i think about my dream seriously
the lectures were well covered and delivered
because i was usually trapped in some tempts like some new tv series shopping physically or online browsing new contents on phoneand the most horrible thing is that although i know i should keep away with these tempts and word hard but i can  t restrain myself
browsing social media conversing with classmates and discussing things that are not related to lecture will hinder success
of course there will be a small number of students because of some reasons or tired may be more easily distracted or sleep
eye contact8
our students are always nervous and confident when giving a talk
first of all i want to say that i have to accept all the difference from living to studying
in my undergraduate education in china my knowledge of learning is relatively basic and in the postgraduate study in the uk the knowledge acquired is very strong
i  m always trying to learn by visualisation so very often i  m drawing graphs charts schemes etc
ithink i learn too much about how to give a talk from our lectures and ourteachers
a strength was that we worked well in a timed activity paper tower for an orange and came together in terms of ideas
they are entirely two different majors one that involves computer software programming and hardware compilation
in these 3 months in york everything is getting on well
i am the second kind of student mentioned above and good emotional management is crucial for my next study
during the induction i am surprised that i made extra new friends
in fact i need think more for example what i need to expect
for example in law class sometimes i cant keep up with the teachers rhythm
i need to do a lot of homework in china but in uk i almost do not have home work5
i used to think drafting was awaste of time but it really helps to structure and organise a report
bad expression
all the members of the group were dissatisfied with her
i think in this area all of my teachers have a good job
if you dont know what your team think then you have no barometer to measure your performance and therefore no way to improve
in the group work i was not very active andenthusiastic but passively accepted the tasks assigned by the group leaderwhen encountering problems i did not actively think about solutions
i usually highlight sentences in different colors in order to help me have better understanding
i can not keep aclean work space and create a logical filing method so i  m always able to findwhat i need although i know that this increases efficiency and helps the rest of the teamstay on track too
many lecturers use body language to express humor and logical
for example for each class assignment i have a little fear i dont know if i can finish it and i dont know what i need to do for these assignment
and in both years i was accepted by theuniversities
i think the similarities can make our team more efficient and the differences will obstruct our progress
the tutor said to us we can communicate with him whether we meet problem in life or study
every workingday night i would review the slide of lecture and make the detailed notes
from observing the lecturers i will take good posture body language and perhaps use some humor to ease an audience when presenting a talk
i will work to these principles during my study and working life in the futurewellin my studythe most challenges for me is i am not familiar with the law system in ukso i need reading lots of documents and papers before our lessons but sometimes i can not understand them very well in my taught msc
firstly my firstlanguage is not english therefore in the class i can not understand well of tutor  sspeaking i have to prepare the content before and i have to listening veryhard to understand what the tutors say
and it can be more obvious in the area of writing the report sometimes even i know the general idea of myself i dont know how to express myself better in english
moreover most of them have job experience
this is my biggest bad habit
i think achieving everyone greatest value is the most important issue in the collaborative
the patterns of behaviour i have witness may also be due to a few h level modules also containing undergraduate students
which means that i need to get rid of some bad behaviours and the habitsthat prevent me from becoming a good student
because time is limited what is recorded must be an important point and should be as short as possible
it helps when youre on the same wavelength with others for when its time to hunker down and work hard and for when its time to take a break
in the process of learning even if no one around me disturbs me i always grind it
i always review after class and preview the ppt before each class
to be honesti really love this teaching stylei do not have any observations
yesthe teaching style of group discussing and team work building is something what i really expectedand there is too much different from my 4year studying experience in chinese universityi think this kind of teaching style will be more interesting and helpful
for the academic work i am very interested in it i like to studythings i did not know before and present my own idea on it
then conflict become more and more irreconcilable
to be honestit is exceeding my expectationit really have lots of knowledge which you can use in the future job which is attracts me a lot
i am looking forward to lean knowledge but worrying about my assignment
yes i believe that i can
i think such people are not good for group development in the group
at the same time provide more information to guide students to study independently
students can take turns choosing their roles or they can choose their roles based on assignments or different parts of the course
sometimes they use the loudspeaker to ensure they can be heard form everyone their speed of speech is suitable for the international students to follow with them
but they all taste good
if some one can finish his or her assignments on time or some blunt people with low emotion quality who offense others unconsciously then the atmosphere can be very embarrassing
i think the mind mapping method is a quite efficient way for me
if you keep to one way of recording notes and specific places for each class youll be much more prepared than otherwiseyou will need to synthesize the most important material to make sure you know what needs to happen and what was decidedthe key questions are like why i take these notes
interacting with lecture and taking notes will foster success
i believe that mutual respect and understanding are effective measures to solve this problem
keeping smiling
of course i also want to bea good student
i am surprised that all students can quickly adapt to this rhythm of learning and life and can be excellent to complete the homework assigned by the teacher
martin is good at organizing and planninghis language is also very goodi think he will help me in languageharry is a exquisite manand he maybe more focus on detailsling is an easygoing girl
because some students regarded it as an assignment so that they just finished and they didnt think it is a good way to know themselves and the importance for the futures group work
but in china we can just have few standard type of answer and teacher recommend us to use the standard answer otherwise we will lose the mark
and heknow which thing he can do and which thing he can not do
on this aspect i couldnt give feedback
the books from reading list helps me learn new terms in advanced
em has exposed tolegal knowledge but environmental design has not
i find honesty and fairness the most challenging
however we are expected to listen carefully and silently in china4
i am not sure but to large extent i think it will be
i was an ipc student last year so i have adapted to the teaching style here and i believe this kind of style can let us think more and let us find and solve problems by ourselves
it is muticulture in my team as you know most asian people speak chinese others speak english
in my opinion i am a “ qualified student ”
when someone encounters a problem the others actively help himherto solve the problem together
for me my notetaking ability is not very strong because many times i think i have understood the content of the class and forget to write it in the notes
i am excited to see some courses like international business and law for engineering management in my modules which i really expected a lot
the induction programme is a good for new student who wants to know more information about the department of electronic engineering such as my own experience
the team members are all excellent
added to my habit of procrastinating things to later time i have a tendency to get confused when in a very topsyturvy situation
in international business classes teachers will collect different attitudes and methods in each countrys management so that i can better understand the background issues in each country when dealing with business problemsthese research evidences and knowledge backgrounds can help us learn more about knowledge
basically there are differences in all ramifications
the way exams assignments and other assessment are assessed is quite different from what i was used to
some lecturers have clear slides
this has indeed been yielding results as best it could
i am conscientious about the path i need to go in orderto pass with success each course
i am absorbed in the academic atomosphere and i want to become stronger toghther with them
most of the modules end with exam and most of us would choose to reviewtwo weeks before exam which help us to have a instant memory
moreover everyone has different experience and different knowledge so when we work together we can create more creative ideas than individual work
although some ideas we could have result or use it he never gives up try to think more and more ideas
and the law is based on the uk cultural background
i have any questions that i can email to tutors they solve the question as soon as possible4
if predict the content of the lesson will be hard i will select to recording content
finally collaborative learning relationship breaks up
engineering management student seems more active maybe these topics are more attractive to them than to other students
these will foster success
some of classmates can have interact with teacher when we have classes the most important thing is their opinion are really mature and professional which let me feel i have a far distance with ma classmates and i need to work more hard on this kind of aspect
1clear leadership：in group collaboration select a clear leader set a clear goal come up with a clear path reduce differences so that the task can be accomplished quickly and directly2
cultural environment york university is an international university
i think that teacher to introduced the lessons is really helpful for the students to know our course more specific
i think the differences in the group will make the discussion more meaningful and you can choose the right one among the different opinions
in addition if i am sad or nervous i would like to running and sweat which could take all the terrible emotions and i will be positive againactually i also stay out at night sometimes it is not a good habit in our life even if i can get up early
i dont think that these people have a lack of interest in the master program itself because normally they are attending the classes but maybe they wont take advantage of all the possibilities that we have
all my lecturers are very pleased to answer our questions
in britain students are required to experience and find problems
from the title slowly deep into the topic and the introduction is very detailed
and every different content have good link which i can understand and accept
in some cases the lectures are well designed to up to date
1have a clear goal2reasonable allocation of work3
we should respect each other
in this process we will learn from each other and encourage each other to stimulate the enthusiasm for learningafter class we can hold group meetings or dinners regularly to promote relationship and to better communicate
4 in china i have not written a report but in uk report is very common
no it might be some difference between we learn the courses before but the engineering management is quite my favourite subject
when we attend the international business course our tutor may exaggerate some facts and form stong comparation with others
in addition the supervision meeting is also very meaningful
improve my ability in writing10
i think lecturers have to introduce their subject in a short term and tell the audience who you are and why you are giving this presentation
everyone is willing to give advice to our team
i also learn some precious things from my group members
because i seat in front of theprofessor in the second row
the occasion that i am not able to understand my notes has never happened when i review them
and the responsibility of group member is significant everyone should be responsible for their own tasks
courses are different and many postgraduate studies in britain are lectures
the students are very friendly the teachers are very kind and my problems can be solved in time
when have group talking they are very active to talk
though the results of each test were not shared with my supervision group one can speculate that a team role preference such as teamworker would be good if it was common among the team members due to reach a goal in a group is a joint effort
sure
during the process of taking notes i would like to use different color pens to write and i use the black one to write normal knowledge and use the red one to mark the focus point
i think i learn three things in our teamworkfirstly everyone in our group are all responsible to their work therefore our teamwork can go smoothly and complete very wellsecondly collaborative can gather each individuals ideas sometimes when i meet some problems my group members can help me think and solve them togetherfinally collaborative learning can correct more mistakes than you just do some work by yourselfthe power of team is strong
the lecture flowed logically，there is a good compact thread connecting each part
if you want to become a distinct student the most important thing is your grade
yes i think so that is why i choose the university of york em
so far i have been happy with my note taking method this term and have not encountered any problems so i have not made any changes yet
the key points are all very important to my future research and final project i believe
in my group the group members are not from the same areas
even if we dont have a dream at this stage we should try our best to do everything best
first of all i cant arrange my time properly
for example as an engineering manager when your boss orders you to do what will violate this principle because of corporate interests
that the preparations are not sufficient might lead to an unsuccessful collaborative learning
some others prefer to write down the everything that teachers said in class
especially environment i think most projects will have some elements influencing the environment in fact sometimes the cost of reducing the damage to the environment is too high to solve the problem and at the meantime you have to think about the costing of the whole project and the net margin
when writing the paper and designer a ppt i realized that i am not good in the logic so i need to modify the structure for many times
team members often do not or just pretending to be a meeting the meeting between the team members did not clear the division of responsibilities rights and benefits lack of the ability of complementary between team members team members did not clear the process of teamwork team members do not agree with the process and system team members can not participate in the major decisions of the team and team cooperation can not get reward team cooperation is not punishment team members cant share the achievements of team and team members to distrust the team leader these are the reasons for the unsuccess collaborative learning
the lecturers will list the content they want to speak in a systematic way on the ppt and the page design and font size will have a heavy division and logical connection
reviewin chinait is very important to review what teachers had toldbut here we need to explore more knowledge by ourselves after classes8
international business i think this module has a different touch to it and to top that up john always has some fun activities in store for us
the roll call will be counted as part of your usual grade and points will be deducted if you dont show up
in conclusion the bad student belongs past two weeks and i will be a diligent student and a better man in future
of course i will try my best to understand my notes as i can not indicate the test question i have to understand all the points which teacher mentioned in their lecture
i do aspire to be a distinction grade student i finished the bsc with a first and i would like to at least keep that standard of work up going forward
as we in the situation our mind may not as sensible as usual for the reason that we may be tempted by profits or may have pressure to make a living
no，i think it is very normal
however i am very worried about whether i can graduate successfully and get a degree after one year
usually members have different work to finish in a group it would beeasy to distribute different mission like marketing finical or computertechnology to different
because i think i have less changces too speak english now
only with the help of others can we grow faster
some of thegroup members may be not so energetic and active instead they are a bit lazyand passive and contribute very little
the ppt slides of the lectures were designed with logic and the lectures flowed logically there would be some cohesions before introducing us to the next subject
when i have lost the initial freshness and passion i slowly realized that i have wasted my time many times which means that i feel very confused especially after listening to many career courses and participating some job fairs later
it will be waht my expected
but sometimes the emotional and personal feelings of employees affect the stability of the compliance guidelines
when i have doubts i would ask experienced people to listen to others opinions
it is a good way to develop teamwork skill and spread our imagination
they figured out my questions every time
some peoplethink that students should have the freedom to choose their academic attitudei totally disagree with that i think as a student we have an obligation totake every student job seriously
i also hope that the teacher can ask a specific question and then pass the students answer to the question to judge the degree of understanding of the knowledge point
maybe it is quiet a big problem for my notes taking
in addition i can provide some creative ideas for my group
all of the team members should have the same goal that everyone can be improved during the collaborative learning and improve different skills for example the negotiation skill the ability to work in a more efficient way as well as finishing the task successfully on time
i didnt really get through half of the technology and half management programme although i studied industrial management for my undergraduate programme some of them are still limited to theoretical knowledge so i am very much looking forward to this kind of learning in msc project management
yes of course i like the challenge because i can find my own deficiencies through the process
mutual help learning mode is conducive to building team friendship but also helps to complete homework with more efficiency and high quality
studios and recording gears easy to access compare to previous uni
for example i got up every morning to read in english or listento the bbc but i am often attracted by the warm quilt
his delivery is really great he always use body language
i am still trying to refine my time management skills but am making improvements and constantly reviewing my strategies
only thing i think needed to e changed is the time slot of afternoon session
i think my academic performance is acceptable
all the lecturer would speak clearly to make sure students could understand what they taught
we have a bad time management during this activities which led us dont have enough time to make the tower higher eventhough we have idea
i enjoy every lesson
the induction let me know the significance of reference and enhance my writing skills
only in this way i can insist on learning
and work in unity is also very important for a group some people is good at this point some people is good at other point the cooperation can increase the work efficiency
i think understanding and trust are essential for successful collaborative learning
i major in accounting in the past but i change my major for studing more konwledge with many worries
as a worked person i clearly know the importance of teamwork
if there are disagreements we can have a discussion about teamwork and how to assign work based on individual ability
we have undertaken very limited work as collaborative groups
in a lecture i even fell asleep at the first 10 minutes of lecturebecause i was so sleepy
while i actually enjoy the time i spent on reading and writing something which leads to the fact that every day here passed so fast that i have to treasure and manage the time well6
each of us have helped in someway to fix the problem
someone has critical thinking in class when tutors ask questions and has many ideasbesidessomeone can speak english fluently
something like this would surely work in the downfall of the team
i think it is not good to keep mobile on inthe class and i think keeping some notes is a good habit for us
now many computers for students to use
the main thing is that everyone will make progress from teamwork
she is so kind during class
i feel i learn some skills for lecturers i will try to use body language and eye contact
i have to admit that i have made a big accuracy mistake in one of my project designs and then it triggers my thinking about the fact that if it is one of my works it would be a serious accident we engineering professionals should always act with care
10 in china student dont have their own supervision tutor
i knew we will have many teamwork in the next year and i need to learn how to get along with team members and help each other do the best when we have teamwork
john is the most humour teacher in his class he often gives some interesting and vivid examples to explain some obscure and difficult concepts
i always discuss with my group members sometime we may have different thought so we may quarrel with each other
mind mapping is not a good way for me to take notes because i dont know how to distinguish those key words
this kind of thing happened many times during my growth perhaps because my mother was busy with work since i was a child and my father  s way of raising tends to let me develop an independent personality so i often disturbing all of my original plans because of other peoples arrangements and plans
because the content is brief and clear in order that i can know about the task and process of this session
we can make progress faster that single work
i used to believe when i first meet them we can easily start a chat about our study or background because i thought western people are very passionate
and try to build the deep trust in my team
taking notes can let me consider about the structure order word etc
so he helpsus a lot when we design a logothird it is important to have a good communicationwith other members
such as learning time schedules or teamdecisions
in china if you want to enter university we need to pass the college entrance examination at first
for instance they make jokes on german and trumph of course no means of offense
reflecting back on my notes after some time also assists me to do more and think more
however i could communicate with each member of the group and help them with the discussion
not engaging or attending will obviously not help this
we can help each other to achieve our own goals
the questions i ask are always few and the sound is not loud enoughin the group discussion i will hesitate and be difficult to make a decision so i rarely decisively decide whether an idea is feasible or not feasible
so overcoming laziness will be a step for me to be a good student
in addition allocating tasks according to person  s strength can increase efficiency
efforts to overcome different cultural differences and frequent group discussions can better develop new ideasand then communicate and discuss with the teacher to understand what the future modules need to learn in the task assignment of the group and help each other
being in a restrained atmosphere would only hamper our success
when i try to collect some data on theinternet my attention may be attracted by small advertisements popped up onthe web pages
in the past few weeks i often missed the next point of knowledge in order to remember important notes
yes，i think it is hard if i want to finish my study
at the end of the course he will summarize itprofessor njs course is one of the courses that i like very much as it is related to technology
it is interesting
i think too much creativity but no action is not good
group discussion is very common in britain and group study is often carried out6the food is different
for international students reading materials will be slower
cooperation is the presupposition of all group working
1foster success 1 try to cooperate with others especially in team work
i hope to make the best use of this master  s programme to improve the personal and technical skills of mineso it has been three years since i have completed my undergraduate degree and after gaining industrial experience inbetween these years i am into my student life all again
yeahi think we will be a great team
i believe that working ahead of time may help eliminate any issues or concerns
as i mentioned in the first question the most important question is the collision of thoughts
but after scheduling my timetable and the limited time constraints that i have here in the university my habit of pushing things to a later time has fairly decreased
everyone of them sometimes used images and examples to explain the subjuects to students they sometimes even told some jokes to make us laugh out loud which i think is very brilliant
making notes is very significant in my class so i often take notes during lectures and homework
they ask us such as does it make sense
last week in our lecture of international business we had a assignment of perform a drama which can indicate the culture difference among multiactive linearactive and reactive
in the coming weeks expect more people to actively participate in class discussions and get good grades together
according to my observation lecterer who use slides dont use notes and speakers who dont use slides use notes
and pills from the north of china were more willing to have creative thoughts
surprisingly the cornell note taking method is clear and concise and the summaries area helps me a lot in reviewing after a long period
for the distingction grade i didn  t think much about it before but i  m thinking more about how i can the combination of work experience and newly acquired theoretical knowledge provides a deeper understanding of management theory and lays a good foundation for future career development so the final academic results are not too high claim
it is difficult for us to handle the balance
but i am trying best to make myself love them
a
then i started to practice because there was no audience i had to practice in front of the mirror it worked very well because i could see my facial expression and decided whether the body language is suitable for what i want to express i even sent my friend a video call and asked him to listen carefully and give advice
i think that each teacher explained the content of what they said very clearly
every member engages in this group working and follow the schedule on time3
therefore there is not a lot of generation gap between us
but i think only a few cases may be unsuccessful because most people can work well through communicating with others
those are very attractive things for meto some extent the introduction programme changed my own learning and the perception of msc engineering management
in the future group work i hope to challenge the leadership of the team
i think there are some courses such as marketing that will give you some familiar examples to illustrate the knowledge points
i have never expected we can be provided many opportunities for interaction during the lecture
my home study will do a lot of arithmetic and physics problems
perhaps doing all the researchyourself might be more proper way to thoroughly study a subject but sometimesa good guidance would be a game changer
finally i will create one sessions notes very clear and easy for me to directly identify every key points and necessary information
while studying very hard but i am very happy1
i should learn to cooperate
although they can not be generalised it is undeniable that thetime to get up is early and the learning time will be long
i do not take an active part in club activities
communication and having a leader is very important because when we work together facing some problems we need to gather everyones ideas to produce the most effective method
i think they need talk more and show us their thoufht and become more positive
now whenever i recall this thing i always feel regret
my previous learning may just be to learn new knowledge constantly but the induction program made me realize that there is a learning log which makes me feel that i lack selfsatisfaction and reflection process in my own learning
i have noticed that our different academic backgrounds have had an effect on how we have each dealt with the course material
as long as we work together we can definitely learn better and better with the help of our supervisor and tutors
therefore iam sure that i have spend much more time on study now compare with in college
so do your job after knowing what you need to do
team workingon the induction week in york university we were introduced to our group and still we are working in a group thats a great initiative and learning technique because in the start it was really hard to share things with people whom you dont know but with time and bu studying international business and personal effectiveness class lectures they changed me completely as compared to my first degree i didnt even think about it 9presentationthis is the best thing i have learned from here in my first degree i never did any presentation because that university focus was on exams so by studying i learned how to do presentations and get confidence by speaking in front of people that what we really need it
and those excuses include often doing anotherleisure activities
i didnt participate induction i arrived late due to visa issue
he has not used note in his lectures yet
7different attention is required to ask students for example，critical thinking
at the same time if we have some drawbacks other members also point to us and we will alter it is a perfect method during our workcollaborative learning is critical for us and could help us become better
in this way they will not be able to learn new knowledgeindependent learning is an important indicator every graduate student should have such skills
it can let us understand the complete company and also understand the cause and effect in whole things
i think i need to organize my time more efficiently in order that i can keep a balance between learning and everyday life
people in the group may have different thoughts but they need to reach an agreement through negotiation and discussion before thet start their work
it was an intriguing area for me to explore hence why i pursued engineering management at university of york
but the biggest challenge is the deadline sometimes i may forgot to submit my assignment before the deadline because of a lot of things and homework
to show levels of significance i will use mark to highlight the important points and color pens to add some other points on my note book
she always wanted to us beproactive in the classes and i perceived that she loves the course that shetaught us
smile nod or applaud to show support for the right opinions or opinions of othersreflect
the extracurricular reading materials provided by these teachers are very professional and are very conducive to improving my academic ability2
secondly i need to spend some time and energy to handle some life trivia such as shopping and cooking
some members have strong english reading ability，so it will be read much faster
in the future i hope i can completely conquer these 2 problems and achieve high effective learning for my postgraduate study
i usually thought that my homework was not finished and i was immersed in a pleasant chat atmosphere
i have searched the internet to find some good advice in taking notes and i have explored by myself eitherthen i found that if i do the preview of the slides and prepare for the jargon or the term i can not understand it will lighten my burden of understanding
i think one of the important things for collaborative learning is we need to know where each other is good at
therefore effective communication will narrow the gap between us and help us set up a common goal
to much legal nouns not only increase the difficulty of listening to lectures but also the twohour lectures can be very boring
after that our tutor will give some example to let us feel more about the theme
study hard and play hard
in this semesters teamwork i learned the following points
if you throw everything away to your mind and dont do anything your teammate will suffer from you they need to carry out your job
besides that we also have many guest lecturershere we have at least 8 different guest lectures in our law lecture
for example they made jokes and provide the relative examples of some celebrities which is a good way to engage students interest to understand the lecture unconsciously
people from different cultures sometimes have different thinking ways and different methods of solving problems
sorry i have missed introduction week
and we also need to write essay it can help us to improve writing skills
everyone should be punctual8
whenever i need to give a talk i must be confident
these behaviors will hinder success in groups and individuals
i need to not only understand the concept but need to know to use a lot of management method6
also i need to keep that learning habit so that i can understand more in the lecture and dont need to search the unknown vocabulary during the lecture time
besides the presentation i also think my english writing and speaking is not good enough
i think independent study and summarize our mistakes are quite import during our studies
i can use these key points to recall the content of the entire classroom
i was grabbed very fast by some interesting things
i believe we can although of course now also covers aspects of so many strangers but as an academic explorer widely understand relevant knowledge is necessary but one thing is very challenging because we have is related to the ability of students it is hard to avoid some of the academic achievements of others or successful code direct copy and reference if there is no question of just test but is used for commercial or academic fraud is a very serious problem but we will avoid the occurrence of this phenomenon by strict self management
i could observe that mostof my classmates act very well
not too much words on the slidespractice more before the presentationuse some examples to support your ideahave some gesture when we giving the presentationdo more research to prepare the presentation
5 there are many related materials that need to be read in advance6 there is more practical learning content
the focus is on selflearning after the class
the results are i can not follow the teachers mind well
teaching methods are far more differentback home
i should keep smiling to make sure that my voice can be heard by all the audience
organize as many group discussions or group activities as possible so that everyone can understand each other to adapt to different cultures which can help the team to improve work efficiency
i think it is useful they are happy and kind to answer my questions
i think there few situation where the challenges will exist
i chose to have an afternoon nap and then got up to enjoy cooking dinner which whole progress took 2 hours with tv shows playing
if you speaking chinese all the time it does not respect other people who can not speak chinese
i also interested in amt but only a few chances to get in touch with students who study amt
if the team is grouped by the same type of people the idea might be limited
in addition this method can effectively attract the audiences attention and prevent the distraction
within same 24 hours some people can still run write read etc
collaborative learning is one of the significant factors
briliant
i think the activity of advertising was the most helpfulit helped us to know each other in group
another skill is presentation skillin thursdays international business class i was invited to stand on the stageto make a small presentation
however the current operation focused more on team cooperation and more consideration needed to be given to the issue of coordination between the groups and the allocation of human resources10
in the class i use a small notebook to take my notes
enterprise noel and bidyut taught this course together and they have different task in this course
but in this teaching style we can have our own thoughts to share
now i think i make a progress in english listening and notetaking in these three months
besidesshe recommends a book named the fourth industrial revolution to us
if there is no way to reply immediately it will also give you contact information to solve the problem
i know this is a very bad study habit although it is very efficient but it is not conducive to the quality of the work
the quality of the answer will influence our final exams mark and the attendance is important to the final mark either
during induction programme i confirmed that team work is very import
when there is no clear purpose and direction of a cooperative study it is likely to become unsuccessful one
with this clear outline we can search the information about the topic and define what we should going to talk about
some of us almost never show their thoughts and they perform carelessly in our group work
because sometimes when i heard some new knowledge from other students i feel surprisedand another thing surprised me is that spoken english of some students is good which encourages me to study english harderwhat did i expect
i will make the mind map of this course arrange the notes and do some exercise in the afternoon
and after class i will make notes according the powerpoint and what i have understood and remembered
yeschallengesfor examplewhen i write reportsi may have difficulties in rephrasing a idea from sourceshoweveri must try my best to rephrase to avoid plagiarism
i learned what i would learn in the next year
so i have to keep a balance between study and entertainment and it is a tough process for me
exactly it is
first i will determine the team goal and the medium team members
with the reading list i would review the note about a week
different ways of teaching
a student in my class usually preview lab scripts and he can finish tasks fast then discuss questions with the teacher
like my classmate shihan zhao who is a hardworking girl
in addition our lecturers often use some interesting examples to help us understand better and make the classroom atmosphere relaxing
personal effectiveness and masterclasses the course is much easier than the others
resilience tells me that it is helpful to face life and others with a positive attitude
first of all the first surprise i found was that the classmates in the class were very serious in their lectures although sometimes they often did not understand the international students in the classroom
it also means we need to spend more time on it make every teammate happy with it
the difference between the past learning methods and the current learning methods is selflearning
i remember tutors had ever told us we should keep balance between study and activities but it is a little difficult for me to pay more attention to my study
this session provide me a brief idea of the personal effective course
last year i prefered study in my own room and if i have any problems i may discuss with my students and sometime i will ask my tutors
in general the speaker would introduce some background or application of the main content to improve audiences interest and then a main point will be given to them
yu qin have a high standard for the work result so she can urge us to have better worksyuxi yang and yujia xue can creat new ideajing tang and hanjie zheng strong power on implement
my course mates are fairly similar in their behaviour some of them dont turn up to all of the timetabled lectures
however its not so comfortable when you raise your head in whole class
in addition for the tasks that the team need to be done whether i can have enough teamwork to complete the group work more efficiently and achieve mutual help and mutual victory
at the moment i almost go to the sport centre three times a week and i want be healthier and stronger even if i am a girl
in the the last degree our examination method is the examination paper
this greatly improved team cohesion
in general most of the lectures are designed to be interesting
each member must clearly define their own division and complete each step in order to successfully complete the task
i think everyone must focus on our own task and be responsible for what you did and what you should do
i will concern about the teamwork because different people in a group who may have different way of deal with things so i hope the teacher could help us if we have some problem in the teamwork
chinese students are dominant in our class however most of us are reluctant or shy to answer teachers questions actively in the class
1undergraduate study is not very demanding on selfstudy
compared with chinese teaching style i found that firstly english teaching style pays more attention to the combination of theory and practice secondly they pay great attention to intellectual copyright protection which can respect the results of other peoples work i think that is very good
before induction week my assumption was that this msc will follow a similar path to my undergraduate studies in terms of the structurelayout of modules as i have experience with the department of electronics
ninthly we seldom use the powerpoint in class in china
most of the first degree studies are professional knowledge and test ability
after a while i knewthat i should do the homework but i would open the tv involuntarily
in a word i use this method to show levels of significance
better scores mean i can make more choices and go to a better school
i can learn a lot in the em major such as the international business law and strategy
but later i have seen some people take their laptop to class and can do some comment in the bottom of each slide
thus i always think that result may be bad
i am satisfied with the induction programme
another model in our group is shuaishuai gu a serious girl she would like to record every point during class i also make notes but i can not write every point that tutors said
besides you need to be familier with your ppt or draft and practise it again and again ensuring that you can speak fluently
it always make me feel tired
then i will use teamwork to solve some problems which is very hard to be finished by individuals
from my personal point of view i hope that in the future i can improve my communication skills so that people can understand my ideas better and faster when i communicate with them in the future instead of having to make some arguments before we can get conclusions
i am a team worker finish our own mission
regular meetings allow team members to respond to questions think and help in collaboration and urge team members to complete their tasks
every day new products are available
i used to exaggerate the benefits of one project which i wanted to draw attention from the investor and i concealed some truths about this project including some potential risks
now i would say it is really interesting homework it makes our teammate get well know each other and know what role might suitable for someone in the future
i will workhard in this break of christmas
of course i like to accept challenges and try to solve them
in addition my spoken english is truly bad and i have to say that the chances of speaking english is less and less in other words i do not think that i have an english enviroment after coming to the uk may because there is much chineses in our classso i hope that teachers can help us to contact english man thank you for that
however i think the way we learned here can help us to have the critical thinking
as i see i found that different people have different strengths
i wish it can help my team working smoothly
secondly english level is an another obstruct because it has a huge impact on class learning and checking materials and there is a typical example about the low english level influence
shopping or chatting with friends can be more enjoyable than studying in the school library
can i obey the principle
it wasnt until the last term that i realized the importance of every subject in my career and started working on it
after a few weeks working together now i can see the different behaviours of our classmates and their different approaches to the programme
but the most part of notes i can take down is from slides of lectures
therefore i chose the engineering management major as the main direction of postgraduate study
thereforei often step into the classroom at the beginning of classi run to the classroom almost every day i did some exercise by the way however i know my shortcomings so i reviewed lectures after class and tried to understand what i did not know in classi think the ability to balance our lives and learn well is also an important thing we need to learni found a good way to relieve stress is to eat delicious foodbritish desserts and sweets are so sweetwhile eating some sweets can make people feel better
the elements used to deliver the lectures are enough to achieve its purpose
i appreciate this because create a good teaching environment
i am just trying to give my best in every way possible
4the homework in the uk is a process of selfexploration by the students while in china it is a process of consolidating the courses already taught
since i choose to study abroad for further study i have previewed the culture and the teaching style before
when you know what you want to do and have a clear goal in life what you do makes you naturally become a good student in college and become a good employee in the company
in the last degree my undergraduate period was four years so in the first two years we had pe
cultural intersection of diversity：when studying for undergraduate degree in china the schools are basically chinese
i think team working spirit resilience commitment and determination are essential for collaborative learning
everyone in the group should try his best to contribute something to the group
she guided to us from start toend in his lectures
yes i think the teachers are kind and responsible
firstlybefore classi will read the books given by my teachertheni will preview the content of pptppx i will confirm or further understand the key information by books or internetin the endi will make some notes by myself think about
i think that listening to the teacher can be used in my speech the teacher and the students eye contact the structure of the teacher ppt is also worth learning and applied to their own ppt production
i was very happy with the induction programme
to check if we understand or not
not long before was i working in a work place where there was no coordination in what we doing
everyone must trust each other so that they can do their jobs better
but the good thing is ive gone from fear to indifference
although there always be a lot of notes i would screen them and keep the useful information
these behaviors really can foster success
not using electronic devices can improve concentration and using electronic devices can improve efficiency
there will be many personalpresentations in class which we have never experienced before
they are good at english so they can help me understand the purpose of programme
team members should unite in a concerted effort to put forward
i have observed 2 students both of them were very hardworking they took notes in every class carefully
if its a very important and significant point i will use redcolor pen to note it on the contrary i will use blackcolor pen to record the less important points
i strongly believe that good ideas is one of the most expensive things now days
i will have the habit of prestudy before class
according to the collaborative learning we can learn a lot from each other
we dont have group
the second point determines the execution ability of the team
hi i am xuan zhang
whats more i found it unnecessary to take notes because i can find all the slides in the vle and there are also some video recorded the lecture for me to listen again
everything is a decision by myself
but i think all of my em classmates want to be better so they come to york
and they donnot wish to interact with the teacher
the staff is really amazing
at the beginning i am a little bit notadapted to study here since there are much difference but now i have already beenused to living in york1 during my undergraduate years theuniversity required us to buy different textbooks for each course but i dontneed to buy textbooks here and much reading material i can read on the universitylibrary website or buy a ebook on amazon and read it on the kindle app2 during my undergraduate years mostcourses were organized around my textbooks while the subjects of the lectureshere are determined by the lecturers3 during my undergraduate years mostweekly assignments were in the written form and some teachers would gradethem while many weekly assignments here are doing presentations or doing some extrareading4 during my undergraduate years students werenot allowed to use laptops in the class while we can use laptop to help usunderstand the lectures better here5 during my undergraduate years student needto take some pe lessons as their compulsory course while we don  t need to havepe lesson here6 during my undergraduate years i have totake at least 6 different elective courses and i will not graduate if didn  t takeenough elective e course while the elective courses here are totally optional7 during my undergraduate years i have topass at least two national examination like cet4 and national computer level 2examination if i want to graduate while i don  t need to do that here8 during my undergraduate years i have to sharea dorm which without a bathroom and a kitchen with two other students while thedormitory here is really different
i should need to prioritise what is important andwhat isn  t according to mark schemes and what the lecturermarker is looking forwhen making the assignmenti also sometimes drift off and day dream when i cannotconcentrate to challenge this i want to get up and go for a walk so it encouragesmental and physical stimulation
our lunch startedat 2 oclock today
as for me i think sometimes i still need to learn by myself because there are some situations i need to learn in a quiet environment such as doing readinghoweveri think i still use collaborative learning in the future in some modulessince collaborative learning can give me more ideas and opinions about the content of modules which can make me acquire more knowledgewhats more after collaborative learning i can accumulate these ideas and form my own opinion and understanding about modulesin a word it is also important for me to use collaborative learning in the futue in modules
by this way i can form a regular timetable andcan benefit from it a lot
i used to write a whole sentence when i taking notes but the problem i often encounter is normally i dont have enough time to write a complete sentence and i will miss the important part of the sentence and write something which doesnt make sense
caring about each other is essential forcollaborative learning
and from this behavior i believe they must understand the course content more and deeper than i do
actually every classmate is very nice and the tutors are very kind
fourth results and debate play crucial functionwhere everybody wins some new idea or theory
during the process i searched the relevant information i found there are many factors lead to samsung scandal
lecturers keep eyetoeye contact with is great
first the company will ask the engineer to abide by the principle
in that teamwork we simply divided the work and then completed the whole task together5testin york in this semester the examination of most subjects is assignment so we need to be able and preferably prepare for the assignment throughout the semester
when i withlecturer eyetoeye i guess i might be questioned
some of my friends have read it but theydont answer yes and just keep keep silence
some students take many notes when listening to the lecture which surprises me because i think its nearly impossible for me to write so many notes like theirs when i listen to the lecture in second language
being more confident and relaxed
the most important thing is discuss with each other and understand others thought
the form of the exam there are more report that i have to finish3
the content what we usually study also be a point to connect closely with next point so the conversion of knowledge point becomes natural and fluent
this is a great help for me
the third part is language barriers
the same function assignments such as to make group videos or to develop group ideas and present it are all full of fun and beneficial to understanding
whether it is the opening speech or the conclusion it is very logical and clear in structure
in china they will not do so in class
a failed teamwork can waste a lot of time on quarrels and suspicions rather than pushing the teams tasks forward
finally mutual communication and communication are carried out in collaborative learning
other groups just gave up when they saw our work
the girl in our group qichen she is a very thoughtful girl
therefore that is my opinion about scope and specification of the lecture
on the other hand through this lecture i think this is the most closely related course in the field of engineering management
in general i feel a huge change in my life
i have made many foreign friends and really learned a lot about the cultures of different countries and regions through contact during the last two months
for instance before internation business next week i always read some books for next weeks session from vle so that i can find the evidence and introduction for knowledge in class such as hofsteders dimension and lewiss culture types
i didnt think that everyone would have their supervisor before the course guide started this surprised me
i heard that some groups only have 2 to 3 members worktoo hard in the activities and others only do very little work
group competition surprised me its the first time i have group competition during induction programme
things are getting better and learning is no longer a problem for me
first i need to know how to express my ideas in effective way
the first reason is that everyone in the group has a different level of knowledge which results in some people having something to say and some people having nothing to say
therefore i hope that both my partners and i can manage ourselves and use english more in our study life
secondly i will learn that their voices are loud and clearthirdly i will learn to watch audiences at all time and pay attention to eyecontact so that the audiences can understand me clearly and once they have any questions i can notice and answer them in the first time
the lecturers are friendly and easily approachable
since i keep doing sports three times a week for over three years
unfortunately it will be very difficult to achieve for me because i  m devoting my time not only for academic responsibilities but as well as for my music career passions and hobbies selfdevelopment sport and the most timeconsuming work
most especially the way modules are structured teaching methods learning resources
their body language is very rich they will vividly express what they want to say including eye contact they will communicate with more students as much as possible to deepen understanding and thinking
thus mathematics is more important in my undergraduate major
i learned to respect and trust each other to correctly understand and evaluate others to share results to communicate and encourage
i think this is a big disadvantage of mine i do not strictly require myself so i often feel regretful for the results
for example in terms of planning i prefer to do it in parts while others prefer to do it in wholeone the one hand analysis of languagealthough in britain the common language is english
if all the work had to be discussed and analyzed it would add a great deal of complexity to the whole work
the facilities of the school are very good and it is very helpful for my study
i need to improve my critical thinking during our classanother behaviour is that culture shock i have ever communicated with other classmates who are from uk or other countries some behaviours i can not understand very well
i think the lecture is very good
they are really innovative and they react to the situation which will be really helpful when we work as a team for our projects
in addition we need to understand each other
when studying msc information technology major the teachers lecture style is generally more severe primarily in the introduction of the basic concept and theoretical knowledge
noyes i met my new classmates and new tutorsno
the homework was so weary
if we actually finish these reading lists on time we can be prepared before this lecture with a clear mind of what the content the lecturer is going to talk about
of course you can make some compensation byhard working so lazy is another issue
at first i wanted to write down every word the teacher said but i found it really hard
however there is one thing i didnt like
a person  s excellence will make he or she feels more in the face of others
the lecturer have their own logic and outline for their lecture
we could plan to meet with our friendsor groups
generally speaking the university course usually needs to be studied carefully to understand but the teacher is very clear in class which makes it easier to review the lessoni hope that in the classroom i can see that the students have the opportunity to discuss the content freely for a few minutes
i am looking forward to the next years study and will go all out
first of all the teaching method is different
our group leader is a man who is very competitive
i have regrets in my undergraduate study career
tomorrow when i start fresh i will be less likely to have missed an relistanother disadvantage is that i can  t persist good habits for a long time
moreover there has a chance to resit at school
in the previous reflection the importance ofcollaborative learning has already been mentioned
in the past i want to recite 300 new english words but this plan was abandoned after 3 months i plan to read a book every month this plan was broke after one year there were lots of such plans stifled in a short time because i can  t keep away from laziness
i feel it will not be a successful collaborative learning without the following factors1
in my opinion i like dr baruahs lecture most because hie powerpoint is very definite and i can browse it before class so that i can understand the lecture easily
as i know presentation is part of my grades i feel so nervous about that because i don  t have any experience of the presentation
maybe the problem you feel difficult is very easy for them
i use the way of cornell notebooks to take notes
it is impossible to be as fluently as the english people to speak english even though we stay in the uk for a few years
therestill have a lot of part that i can not mention in this file
some good behaviours such as doing preparation before classes take notes down during classes and review the things that have been studied
so you can read them before class which is a good thing for us foreign students
in enterprise lectureswe are told how to run a enterprise and every session we have a clear draft
its a great honour to work with them to complete various tasks
start paying attention and see if there seems to be an excuse for everything
so i dont make sure the style of classes that i expected
this not only can learn the skills of analyzing problems but also broaden the horizon3learn to summarize the content summarize the contents of the teachers class and record the key content4record important content in a prominent position expand the key content after class and read related materials online
frankly speaking i am still worried about the programme especially some courses such as enterprise strategy of marketing and international business
in my opinion it is more important to think constantly than to take notes
now the internet is full of temptations and these temptations are omnipresent
tony ward not responded good my question
as a summary the most difficult obstacle to me is procrastinationi tend to put other things in the front of the queue instead of completing myhome works and assignments
in the presentation in course of enterprise i perform not well
the most different in study between undergraduate and master is that i study more management theory7
preparation lessons before class i thinkis a very important thing compared to the review preview in advance canprobably understand the content of the class the lecturers to speak write downwhat i dont know the knowledge that i can focus on listening in class where thelecturers can explain it it is not only efficient but also save trouble
meanwhile we can take some notes when we hear a novel perspective we didnt think of
before recruitment i carefully read the course programme so for now im not surprised
therefore recently i have two goals
first of all i will study the presentation skills in the classroom
1hofstedes model of national culture2ichard d lewis when cultures collide leading across cultures 3rd ed 2006 nicholas brealey international 3crosscultural design electronic resource cultural differences in everyday life 5th international conference ccd 2013 held as part of hci international 2013 las vegas nv usa july 2126 2013 proceedings
like sometimes i did the preparation and i found it different during the lecture with the version i have downloaded last nightas i have mentioned before we all enjoy the sense of humor of our lovely lecturers
in china we will finish all the assignments in that term and will never start an exam or set a deadline at the beginning of next semester9
these relationships are friendship inschool which will help everyone improve their efficiency they arerelationship of partners in work and bring benefits
and do a good preparation for futureto be specific fristly i have a bad habits now
for example the focus of international business is international so culture is very important
secondly notes do not need to write down all the content the focus is still on listening just need to write down the key words they can understand it
regarding johns session the module content has made me think more about the different cultured groups
this is the most element in one presentation
taking the recent personal experience as an example i started my postgraduate study for a month now but i really didn  t have much time to study seriously
i start to organize the key words and the main points in class and from the course texts
for sureit is an excellent style for me which could improve my communication skills teamwork leadership execution and innovationfor instance the game that we make a tower as soon as high is really interesting in group which promote our relationship during a short time
i met classmates from different countries and they are all very nice
yestutors always motivate us to do some tasks and give us some useful advice
yes it has changed a little bit it was more interesting than i thought
suitable interaction will be really helpful so i will try to ask some interesting questions to audience to make them concentrate and relax
he used eyestoeyes contact
however some lecturers slide have too much contents which is difficult to get the key points sometimes
almost every lecturer did very well in this area
what we should do is establishing good communication channels and sincere cooperation when facing challenges
sorry，i cant
it is obviously the characteristics of students from different program has large variance
finally the results may seem not as good as what planned2
he was engaged with eyestoeyescontact
during the undergraduate course i only need to learn what the teacher said
i need to letmy mind be full of english and using english logic to share my opinion
some contractors wanted to give some money to me sothat they won the contract
third reading the relevant article and journal understanding the newest information about our major
he prepares videos examples pictures and audio files which helps me to understand things better
like most of students i aspire to be a distinction grade student
secondly it isvery important thst cooperating finishthe team work however many times we also should finish some work belong to myselfapart
ive not had the need to ask any questions during a lecture but whenever i have enquired about a certain topic to a lecturer they have been more than happy to provide guidance
more focus on team rather than only on yourself
thank you guys a lot
cash flow is the blood of business
in the meantime if she offends others we should pardon her
according to the induction we can know about each other and make friends easier
this will affect the speed of my records
understanding others viewpoints and meanings
therefore the course is difficult for mepersonal effectiveness and masterclasses this course is easier than the other and i have some experience of using the basic tools such as word and powerpoint
o researching and academic writing by myself but i often doubt that whether the grammar is correct or the source is suitable
i feel that attending as many lectures as possible will foster success as well as fulfilling the recommended forty hours of study per week
all in all i do appreciate the induction session and it help me a lot
one of our teammembers seldom puts forward his own ideas and even talks very little2
it is very essential for the members to be able to express their thoughts on the project without being shy while also expressing concern when they feel uncomfortable with a certain part of a project
many of them have work experiences that enable them to be more creative and have many good ideas in the team work2
in class i can only listen and write down what i think is important
i tried my best to use my arms to move add some hand gestures and kept smile all the time
in my mind the teaching style of western is focusing on practicing
in response to the questions raised by us they can always answer clearly and concisely，and give us their clear views about that
yes ibelieve most of lectures are been delivered in the right course and the prereadinglist in the vle helped a lot
hope to have something to learn
professor jhon issitt i heard very well because he speaks loudly
the lack of sufficient diversity of 3 people and the groups below may not be natural to develop divergent thinking
in the negotiation of contracts with contractors i am goingto be a clear with payments´ days
and in team tasks it is very important to know that everyone has advantage and properly assign tasks
i think this could be the life that i expected
the equipmentand facility are very nice
they can  t improve themselves from studying with their membersand there comes the bad ending
i have the strong willing to think more but i am lack of the ability to consider comprehensively。
in my opinion behaviors like keeping integrity keeping diligence being tolerant and learning will foster success
feedback4
i didnt officially hire engineers in china just done engineer team of interns roles assistant team and so on the basis of british engineers moral law i think i could under the “ accuracy and rigour keep their knowledge and skills up to date present and review theory evidence and interpretation honestly accurately objectively and without bias while respecting reasoned alternative views ” after all i do not have the main position and this knowledge lacking consciousness so do the chores in internship career more professional also need to be further strengthened
but i am really concern that the elearning log is very timeconsuming
the induction programme told us how to have critical thinking and we shoud have enough evidence to support our opinion
we only need to coordinate our habilities in harmony
when it come to the summary i alsomark them with red color which means that it is significant
if meet some questions you shouldnt be shy to ask your group members or teachers for help
i want to be responsible for myself and the team members and must overcome the delay
my group member not really active as me and they just want to do the minimum things in the areas of studying they just want to pass the exam and graduate
how do you put these things in
in addition i also like to mark special symbols to show levels of significance
i think some activities like campus tour should be added
i think the mentoring session and professional training is very important
secondly preclass preview and afterclass review are not very good
in universities team work is important because while doing team work together i can learn from others and improve my personal skills simultaneously
i spent more time on selfmanagement and tried new things to explore more potential in my future life
i think respect confidentiality and assist the development of engineering is helpful to our course
lack of clear goalswhat kind of students we want to be and the future direction of employment are still uncertain2
well because its a master programme i think we have to be even more responsable than the undergraduate programme and be more determined
teamwork is an important skill in collegelife
this is the important reason why we use it in enterprise project
i always procrastinate and waste my time on many meaningless thingsalthough i still hand in my homework on time to be honest i really hate that sense of urgency
i dont know how to complete it very well
i think that i must improve my speed of reading andcomprehension because i spend a lot time to understand some concepts or topicsi am using strategies of good engineering management readers ”
while doing this process i will use different font words to emphasize their different importance then i will arrange them logically
i needed to be paid much attention to when chinas scientific research and intellectual property protection were relatively weak
honestly in the last few weeks my notes were terriblein class i always wanted to record everything the teacher said but as a result i had no time to write
the lecturers dont use notes which makes what they are saying clearer and you can tell that they are thinking about what they are saying rather than just reading from a script
i plan to let them do the parts that theyinterested in or good at in the future
therefore everyone gradually made a more active speech
when talking abhout humour i think the lecture in international business used lots of humour and students always bursted into a laughter
but the unsuccessful experience also exists and that is the problem in some details
in one day teacher asked us read some materials about tesla so that we could learn deeper about management and marketing of technology
if different people have different thoughts in a work they will never perform well
what surprises me is that i saw someone even came to class without a laptop or a notebook many times
bbs course outline is very obvious
but now i cant keep going this habit because the lack of selfcontrol
i was very satisfied with it
different languages
while what did i expect was that all of the students can interact with tutors actively however in fact we are quiet in class
i dont have stage fright which is the most important thing for me to improve
i have objectivichtive thinking which help me make a reasonable decision and i have strong power on implement
the most helpful activity for me is to build a towel together
the pacing of the course is a lot quicker
therefore i need to learn to balance work and life
i see the importance of covering all of the delivered material and see that missing out on lecture material and on the lecturers description of that material may hinder a students ability to understand the material
so i think this is the ideal course what i expected before
i think communication and characters can affect my work in a team
and it is the first time for me to study aboard and it is the first time for me to live in another country alone
then ill go back to the first line and reread and figure out the words i dont know
they are all patient and humorouslast but not least i feel a little trouble in notes
1the attitude to learn good thing from others i need know what things are i did not have
i have some concern about the course of management and acconuting
this is a simple introduction about myself and also to answer the question
it is so important for everyone to become adistinction grade student
i will try my best and work with my group members to ensure these challenges not becoming problems
i think i do not have all these abilities now and im trying to develop those skills
first i will go to understand the cultural background of each member of the groupand then i will communicate with them and become good friends with themi think there is no gap between friends
civil engineering has less presentation to do but there are more
it becomes unsuccessful when the team is not have a proper leader and focussed goal towards which everyone is working together
when i studied in the chinese universityour lecturer hope us can independent finishour assignment
when given a talk i will get much knowledge and experience from the lecturers
although they are very friendly it is not easy to be friends with them
when i review my notes i will pay special attention to these questions and guess the possible questionswhen i review notes i dont just review notes but review them with video and teachers lectures
lecturers primarily used computers and a vlelike teaching system to teach us so almost all of the learning materials can be found in the online teaching system which led me not to have a good habit of taking notes
in uk we use theories
when working on a project or an a group activity i will make sure that every ethical aspect is taken care of2
i have a very good example of a situation when my badchoices and behaviors avoid me to achieve my goals
i feel busy and exhausted but i am very happy and fulfilling
in the blink of an eye the fist semester is about to endduring this semester i made some good friends and formed a deep relationship with the members of my supervision group they really helped me a lot both in my study and my life
i am the person who charged in writing the meeting minutes in my enterprise group i use lists to help my group mate to see the main points easily and clearly as well
ican not finish my work as soon as possible
environmental design requiresmore inspiration to work
when i was in china the engineering management i studied was mainly in the management of civil engineering so i hope to learn more comprehensive management skills in the uk
only after many times of learning and comparison can we make progress and carry out learning activities in an orderly way
since there are some courses that have not been learned before i will try my best to master these new knowledge
in other words i can understand most of my notes when i review them because they are all written by the laptop
collaborating learning is more advantage than working alone becausewe can see the problem from different angles
from my previous education histories i studied in chinese for two years for my first undergraduate degree three years in finland for my second undergraduate degree one year in the university of york for my first master degree and i am processing my second master degree right now
there are various forms of examination
i always tried to record every sentence of the teacher
i had 18 weeks a term in my first degree but here a term only has ten weeks
group working and group assignment
i am aware that effective time management will be key this year however from previous experience studying i am now confident in the time management strategies that i have developed
this is a very beautiful and safe city with convenient living
after the induction programme i found most of the course is about the business rather than the technical skills
because i am responsible for the part of the market so i need to consult a large number of valuable literature and websites to make judgments and predictions
there were difficult timestrying to gather all the information and it requires a lot of effort but aftersome hard work focus and commitment in the target i finally got the requiredscholarship needed to come to hereonce started my msc course i found that the academic work presentedand expected at the university of york represents a new challenge to me
i like how our program is smaller with less students taking each module
this difference in way of approaching similar problems can be very helpful when discussing with one another as it broadens ones prospective and directs towards thinking outside the box
they often do not understand the requirements from the lecturer
and by the last term i saw my progress and was really happy with it
the important thing is how to solve it
every time before the lecture the teacher will upload theircourseware to vle in advance which allowed me to download it to my computer inadvance and make a previewhowever i think there is still some gaps betweenme and distinction students
the format of the article the quotation and so on all need to follow the teachers requirements8
therefore try to think about the problem from the perspective of others it can reduce the bad collaborative learning
moreover too large a team will appear to makeup some people eat for nothing and so on the phenomenon
fortunately with the help of my teacher and classmates i have learned it now
the right thing to do is if it can be done today do it today
firstly active communication isvery important thing
i think it is really useful for my study in this termfinally teacher also taught us some useful methods during our study like avoid dozewounderful
i cherish the time of studying in york verymuch
at the same time clear slides help students better understand the content of the lectures
as my experience i could display a nonproductive behaviours in the situation which topic or content i don  t understand and i don  t do anything prework
furthermore i believe that people should avoid talking about themselves or making humor too often as it becomes hard for them to be taking seriously
i like to face some challenges in my future courses
yesbut i hope more communication between different groups
collaborative learning is useful not only for our study but also for our future career
other problems i think is personal behavior at least i won  t do that
i think that i should learn more leadership and communication skills
what prevents me from becoming a good student is thelack of time management and the execution of the planin pastfew years my work was more followed by the companys plan or deal withsuddenly urgent problems in china
everytime they will move to the next point they will ask students if we have any questions
yes i can create my idea
i saw them using intext citation and quotation marks in slides
it may be relatively difficult for me but i believe i can overcome it
i spent more than five hours a week on theeleaching log
we have good eyetoeye connection and they use notes
in the notes i will draw some circles or some underline on the key points to highlight it and vacate a column to write the question
furthermore i think mutual understanding is very useful
i worry that procrastination may prevent me from achieving a distinction
also i find that it makes to spend more time in workshop compare to others
besides not taking notes will make me learn something slowly especially when i was reviewing the exam the pace will be very slow because i have to read a large number of course materials in a short period
therefore when there is a conflict in the group work we should remind ourselves to embrace the others culture understand each other actively seek solutions and learn to adjust ourselves to adapt the cultural differences in the work
we develop our team and achieve our goal easily in the induction activity
i really like the mind mapping because it is visible and easy to read what is the connection with other
facilities the test equipment here is more complete
if the lecture is humour used in anyway for me i must be attracted
university planning must have a clear goal what to do in the university such as what kind of achievements or more social internship experience2
3 set the goals 4 make fiends and to be a good listener 5 to understand different cultures2hinder success 1 stay in the comfortable zone 2 lazy 3 overconfident
we just need some time to adapt
when i was in home there are so many things that can attract my attention
i have asked john questions after class we had a brief discussion and he also patiently answered my question
if you want to grow you must start with a time management and knowledge management systemeffective time management involves four quadrantsthe first quadrant is urgently important
i felt happy with the induction week3
following teachers train of thoughts and working hard will foster success focus on playing mobile phone and pay attention on having fun will hinder success
since i had most of my education done from india where notetaking during lectures has been a practice i had always found it easy to take notes simultaneously during the lectures
but it is very essential to keep a friendly status while avoiding all of the above
most of the teaching styles are similar with i have experienced in the pasthowever some project seems very hard and challenging
the behaviours that will foster success areparticipation in order to succeed we have to get everyone to talk commitment when there is set a group meeting we all come in time and not late so we can work and do as much as we canthe behaviours that will hinder success areshyness when we dont talk because we are afraid of what other will say may cause problems in the team because we may make the wrong decision
when we want to use the humor we need to think more about whether it is suitable or not
the bullets or list of points under it all refer to that one heading20 pattern notesthese are notes that are organised around a central concept and work their way out from that idea
first of all i have a seriousproblem i procrastinate something
the rest of the day is downhill from there
ib there are many basic and important theories such as geert hofstede modle lewis model etc
for the examine i couldn  t understand what is the different between the first question and third question in my exam paper
i am very passive and confused about those works
and these are often required for future exams
lectures and labs have been delivered in just about the same ways that i am used to
however after grouping the other team members are equivalent to teachers can monitor a team member at any time to learn which task is not completed can be detected2 through the group cooperation mobilise the enthusiasm of the team members
i am not sure about this
although i review the slides before class every day that the teacher is going to use i just focus on the slides instead of looking for more information to read and learn
however each member of the group should also have to adapt to each persons way of thinking and respect each individuals backgroundculturein regards to johns international business lectures the work that we have done on the works of hofstede help clarify the many ways a culture acts in term of work ethic
yes it have changed my way of thinking because i can put in practice the imaginationfor instance in my group were formed by three different countriesit was the first time that i was working in group formed by three differents countriesit was very interestingfinally everything will depent on myself
i can download these slides in advance and preread them
for example i can set a specific time for me to review notes such as an hour before the lecture beginning
moreover we have a lot of teamwork the team members all wish to contribute their effort to the teamwork
i think this is not conducive to my improvement
i clearly know that i need to learn to take care of myself and arrange the balance of my life and study reasonably to achieve my study goal since the first day i arrived in the uk
and i do think it is useful for my future study and career
the teacher will follow the temptation start with a simple definition and then gradually speed up the process and difficulty
they are very nice and giving me many fantastic ideas
secondly compared with western classmates i feel that i really lack innovative and critical thinking
they are very responsible and will explain my problems to me
i think this depends on the team members that will study with me in the future so it still depends
everyone listens carefully in class and very few people will be latei hope more people will communicate with teachers in class
before the lecture we can find the ppt or some documents from the vle we can know about what topic they were going to talk about
now i find lots of method in studying the most important one is getting rid of being lazy in studying
sorry i dont understand the meaning of question
obviously it is an efficient way to study and they must get hang of what teachers said
because interaction allows us to really participate in the course and we will not passively accept the boring theoretical knowledge for the whole time of classes
after each class i have mastered the main idea of the class and understood about 95 of the course content
our weaknesses are communication and securitymy team can help me with debating with different topic of different courses and enlarging my vision of coursesfinally to pass the programme with success
the significance of my notes are not important
the style of the presentation is my most want to learn
more working with the group
however many of the achievements of postgraduate study in york were presented in the form of thesis and presentation3
yes i like this teaching style
ability will greatly affect teamwork performance
the classes are also tried to be dynamic by making the students participate
but in general i think it is a good thing that i can get real exercise from both my courage and language during this yeari really hope to become an excellent student and learn more jobrelated skills through this year
nowadays moreand more companies need compound talents which means we have to learn more to getthe requirements
i understand the experience and skills to analyze and solve problems independently
i think the lecturers have very clearly defined what the contents of each lecture has been and will be
is sad to see that for some people the msc studies are not a priority atall
in the group meetings we can share our own ideas to each other
in the responsible leadership i did not carefully think about some areas where advanced engineering and technology can improve the society
there are lots of necessary factors for successful collaborative learning including unity encourage each other justice and equity coordination and so on
i think my current academic performance is not particularly excellent because i have not been exposed to many courses before such as the marketinglaw and so onand the homework assigned by the teacher such as a business plan i feel a little strange to these contentsi have no idea about the budget the market research etcin addition i have some language barriers which may sometimes lead to inaccuracy when i fail to understand the course contentso it took me a lot of time to study after classi am eager to be an excellent student and i enjoy the appreciation when i do well because it is a kind of affirmation of my efforts and valuesi came here from long distances to study for the purpose of making greater progress improving my own value and becoming a better personat the beginning i felt confused and unhappy because of my poor academic performanceother groups were performed wellthey are smart to know how to do wellwhile our group seem to have a hard time to catching up
the final graduation project was also carried out by six people as a group10
for example some of the students are really active in class and always ask their questiones to the teacher
talk about the challenges i think the different culture would makes our misunderstand each other
a good team doesnt have too many problems to overcome but it can also learn the other side
for group work for a complicated project such as masters project in summer coming together to bring different ideas to solve a problem
because academic misconduct is a very unfair way of dealing with the deception of ones own work and the unfairness of ones competitors
if i am a team member i will actively raise opinions and obey the arrangement of the team leader
during in class dr john always gives us some examples to make us understand what he says
i think everything is perfect
for the notes l have separate the notebooks for each course and i downloaded a productive app notability to save all the ppt resources needed in the class which enable to edit the notes flexibly on the documents i imported
the only point against being in large theaters is that since there are a lot of people listening the same class it make difficult a real studentteacher connection
there is more emphasis on practical knowledge8
unless you can work 20 hours a day to make up for inefficiency
they are very patient
members should find the reason why they unsuccessful and transfer them
they are all active and friendly
in general these lectures are very effective but many students can not fully accept them in class
all the lectures are completely prepared and i think the teaching content should be divided into three parts before class in class and after class
thats my culture analyses of my supervisor team
ialways want to have a machine can help me remember the grammar and vocabularyif i have that machine i will put all english words in my brain
so i think that i will have a good improvement when we work together
as its difficult to take notes and follow the lecturer i mentioned several weeks ago i have used a new way to take notes during this period of time
we have a good idea and we can do it immediately but we cant find the effective way to achieve it and second that is the time we all have our own things to do we have own timetable so set a suitable time to do group work is difficult now
of course i need to admit that one of the reasons forthe longterm communication activities is that i am not good at rejectinginvitations from others
in this two months i have to adapt to reading anything in english instead of chinese which is my mother language
showing off is not a good habit
what is building a bridge
this made me feel really worried and anxious
i am really interested in our courses because there are lots of new teaching styles and we never feel bored in classjohn who is our international business lecturer this is the third i mentioned him today his lecture is dramatically interesting
some questions like that to make sure we understand him and can follow his lectures
this allow us to go beyond the classrooms and understand better theworld out there
for example in the fist class of the international business dr john issitt upload some picture of the ‘ hoifstede 6 culture dimension  besides he also uploads a website on the vle
because i want to learn some knowledge about combining technology with music and audio and the programme here has music production courses and audio technology course which are exactly what i want
because each students ability to accept and knowledge is different you should start from the simplest basis and then slowly raise the lecture content
and bidyut is the humorous teacher too when he realizes some students sleep or be distracted he always make a joke about that to pull students back
although i have lots of classes everyday but the classes are less than in china
the number of teaching staff is different
now i basically have a period of time every day to do exercise for myself10
eighth in the study of chinese universities physical quality is also valued
thus the man in china need to afford the family they do a very hard work in their career and this is why i come to here to complete myself and make a preparation for the future challenge
everything is likely to succeed and may fail
open communication4using different strategies changing the way of speaking and changing like using realworld problems5keep critical thinking skills
after the representation i figured outwhy
let us have a clear understanding of the arrangement of the year and the pass rate of the test which will help us to plan our study
this week we learned about pitch and the lecturer explained it with some examples and videos
in my supervision group i met five different new friends
i started to feel nervousand i felt that my breathing was accelerating and my adrenocortical hormonesecretion increased
in the last degree when we want to contact the teacher we can send a text message to the teacher or go to the office to find the teacher directly8the types of courses
but i think the shared kitchen is a great place to share culture and ideas with othersthe last difference is a special difference that i never thought about
is a lifestyle
basically my notes can be divided into two parts the first one is taken when i preview the slides before the class i would take some notes like what does it mean how do i understand it and i would also emphasize the important content or what i don  t understand by colored pen
these are i tend to complete assessed work very close to the deadline i am still used to the third year way of working
however in the introduction to communication i usually take some notes
i must be good at learning the strengths of others discovering my own shortcomings and correcting themfinally be confident be brave enough to express your opinions express yourself and discuss common progress together
in week 3 i joined the first german lesson
the university life in china is busy and the course is very busy
the topic i chose was about the companys changing attitude towards the scandal of the explosion of samsung note7 mobile phonein order to make us more confident about the presentation sarah said that we need to practice one day before the formal presentation in advance
whats more i am scared of failure and mistakesanother factor that prevents me from being a distinction grade student is that i will be proud and arrogant when i make a little progress
he uses humor in orderthat some students do not sleep in his class
but because of thedifferent background everyone will have different accents what is the mainreason to cause a decline in communication efficiencyon the other hand analyze that workaspects
however the fact is there must be something i did not consider well or what i consider was wrong
answer the question patiently
to be honest i have spent two wonderful months in york university
dr bidyut baruah had showed us how to make a wonderful presentation at msc personal effectiveness and masterclasses and the next day in the lecture of international business john randomly picked out students to make a small presentation about specified topics
more group work
i avoid taking notes during the lectures as i am terrible at multitasking
otherwise they would fail3
all lecturers gave their presentation by looking at us instead of reading the powerpoint slides
i need to change it to talk much in the public to let others know i could do well giving up the problem that i will get really nervous speaking in front of other people shame of me
when we attend the course of mangement technology our lecturer tell us the development of electric vehicles
here are much more group work and seminars than i had in the undergrafuate studies
then i should allocate the task for everyone based on the specialty
as for me i will have some tensions every time when i give a speech but the teachers can control and hide their nervous emotions so that others feel like they are very easy to show yourself
i study in university of york now andmy major is engineering management
if you are weak it will be strong
however i am really aspire to get a distinction in my every courses and distinction is my study goal in this master yearafter a month life in the university of york i found i still had some drawbacks that i have to avoidinitially reading bibliography is difficult for me because i need check a lot of strange words and understand their means in reports
in the future i hope our supervisor can talk to us more frequently because during this process he or she can impart key knowledge to us and these knowledge will be really helpful in the future
communication with others analysis about how to build it negotiation with teamworker making assignment help us to become a true manager
when something like this happens i am very concerned about whether i could get my work done in time or not
compared with my previous education ithink there are something differences1
i learned so many things however one thing that i am going touse in future is editing video because i would like to have my own business
in my opinion the lecture design is reasonable which combines real life with theoretical knowledge and uses theoretical knowledge to analyze cases
establish clear group goals this keeps the group on task and establishes an unambiguous purpose
therefore the improved note taking method helps me a lot in understanding of the teaching class and reviewingall in all the progress of my note taking methods shows that i can adapt to the class well now
i am also one of them
like the illustrations diagrams line charts bar charts pie charts pictures all have their sources under them
the only thing i concerned about is time management maybe i will ask help from teacher later
to some extent i will say lecturers in the dse section of the department are doing their best to move me from one point to the other
this gave me the chance to discuss with some of the lecturers about postgraduate studies
being entertaining and informative ？it seems very difficult to meet this requirement
when it was the time i think i can learn something or i can finish some assignments my friends would ask whether i want to hang out join them to a club or something like that
em major includes more comprehensiveknowledge such as finance accounting
i heard that in other group there is a leader i think it is not correct
chinese people like to discuss the conclusion togethersixth china will announce the results of all students to encourage students with outstanding performance and stimulate students with low grades
i am giving all my energy in order to be in this place
another problem is that i will come across different temptations in my work in the future
enterprise lets students explore real new technologies orproducts and develop them into real business plans
this would be very useful
and during the presessional programme i attended the lecture which taught me how to take notes my lecturer has introduced some notetaking methods to us
if the groups members cant cooperate well with each other or even dont want to donate their own strength to finish the task the task can not be finished good or the team can not cooperate perfectly in the workin conclusion the collaborative learning contains many knowledge and we should explore it with our passion to cooperate well
i think the essential factor is respectwe need to respect others thoughts
my writing ability is not good so actually i am a litter worried about whether i can complete my future essay or paper well
i can just keep up with the tutors teaching speed and if i wrote some details down i will miss some part of the presentation of tutor
before taking the class i thought that this class should be the same as the usual classevery student is sitting together instead of sitting at a table with a few people like nowi may be more eager to have more time to discuss ideasbut it is quite surprising that every student is very serious about taking lectures and doing exercisesafter the class is over the knowledge in the class is still being discussed and consolidatedthe students helped each other and the good atmosphere of learning was what i expected
so i think this lecture is very well designed
although it is a good phenomenon sometimes it will cost much time to arrive at the last decision
better than my expected
i take notes slowly but they write quickly
but i still have some difficulties in my study
they will confirm that you are followed by eye contact
i think they usually use the titles of theppt to define their classes  theme and all the content of class is related tothe title
actually i must to say all the classes have some connections i can use the theories from marketing to the course of enterprise
we should create a group with trust
since our course has not officially started the teaching style for the future course is still unknown
i learned the importance of teamwork in group work
and of course i am eager to be an excellent student but sometimes some of my bad habits and personality will prevent my successfirst i lack ambition
they would like to do the eye contact to engage us into this coursestrategy management north delivered much useful information in the commercial strategy and her space of speaking is really slow and clear
i need to read a lot of books and articles inorder to understand very well the concepts and support my idea
for example i couldn  t find the website of the school the materials of the class and i would not use the resources of the library
the principle that relates to me the most would be accuracy amp rigor as during my undergraduate studies i was a part of a group project that was to make a digital multimeter
my bsc also had some 120 students so the lectures were much larger and less interactive compared to this course where there are only 10 of us
even i think i am a bad student in recent time because i dont work hard in this month
i realized this behavior absolutely wrong because as an engineer i need always keep careful especially when it refers to the engineering project
no we are all group work very well and have done the discussion very well
civil engineering is a very boring subject but em is more interesting 8 civil engineering always has a lot o lectures in same day but there are less lecture in every day9
this process can be time consuming and can make negative effects
communication especially effective communication
for example i know a girl who is willing to talk with strangersalthough she was not good at english and sometimes made jokes but that didnt matter she enjoyed the conversation
weifan edited the video and iconstructed the battery
their presentation is comfortable and fluent
meanwhile i will carry out some risk assessment before the preparation of work and try my best to find potential problems to avoid that i can not deal with when problems occurfrom the part of cultural differences i pay more attention to long term orientation and collectivism
participate in the group discuss activelybehaviour will hinder success1 not attending the class2
they would notice our expressions and ask us whether understand what he said
that means i not study hard enough and i lack of plan for language learning and determination
we have different thoughtsso how to coordinate all peoples thoughts is the main task in a groupc
since i was studying my undergraduate degree which is industrial management i always desire to make the further study in this relevant field for half technical learning and half management learning
then i mark every key word so that i can see clearly what i remember
but there is one thing suprised me there is almost nothing about engineering technology
there are some classmates from different countries9feel different customs and holidays such as halloween and black friday10more peaceful city york is a peaceful city with a smaller population
1a important point in here is keep enthusiasm in learning
but in the company you will often take over a tricky job and then you need to do a lot of fast learning
it is more attractive than i expected
sometime he asked the meaning of the sentence that iwrote and he helped to be more fluently than before
i think i may struggle with some of the ios programming but i have already made friends with people who are willing to help as much as possible and even a few people who may want to start a band play music together
last but not least practice makes perfect
often because of playfulness or lazinessi forget to learn
i think this arrangement is suitable
second if someone has insufficient abilities i can help him improve itsuch as how to do the layout of pcb
because of lazy maybe i cannotcomplete the tasks what i planned
in the start it was really difficult and i am improving now10apply theory into real life problem this is the main thing i am learning here how to implement your theory into real life problems and thats the main thingee
i tried to sleep at 12 oclock in the evening
classmates
as the result of my less rigour the assignment i submitted was considered to be unavailable
i think this will make our study and thinking space more extensive
now the professional skills and ideas of masters degree learning are much harder than the first degree6
although i believe theyll come out of their shell soon enough
the preparation of other students was very full and had a lot of content
i think i can motivate others to take action by taking action first
from my perspective the challenges for the engineering manager to follow the ethic may be the threat from the boss of fired if we follow the ethic without looking after the profit of the company
teachers always calm and confident but our students can be really nervous when giving the presentation
everyone tries to use the best example that they can give and i personally feel that john and bidyut try to give the best examples and add humor in their teaching
what impressed me the most was the chapter about the plagiarism
at class tutors will give us basic definition of specific theory or terminologies then after class we will spend extra reading further report and articles to evaluate deeper meaning of these theories that is very help for our students to understand them
our team had a heated argument once but we finally address that and after that we are more like a team and we tend to express ourselves better and execute the weekly tasks more effectively than before
and then i will have a better state to write all my homework my essays my reports
i will pay more attention to my interactions with my classmates in presentation and make my presentation more humorous
i do not feel that we were able to interact enough in the context of our broader course material in order for me to make many of these kinds of judgements
but here more is to focus on teamwork to complete the project as well as personal and conscious learningthe biggest difference is the contrast between york and my previous studies
the group activity was another way to get the students interested in the modules5
there are a lot of people from different nooksof the earth
and after class i always take much time to digest them
the lecturer of strategy and bbs lecture both have strong logical
every week the lecturer invited a professional legal staff to give us some basic background knowledge of the law to help us understand the law
have a common goal
a presentation is included in our course which helps us improve our selfconfidence and language organization skills
teachers material collection is very comprehensive
communication and accountability are crucial
in my opinion different thinking and ideas are the main differences i have observed that affect work in groups or teams
third reward myself with occasional breaks music you enjoy or even a snack
since english is not my first language i cant speak english confidently
in addition in the past i always made poor choices
i like the lectures from people in different companies
in the technology class noel has a good organization for the curriculum and the overall knowledge is gradual
never be late for anything about the group
it quite need a lot of time comparing with the life before
nevertheless i know some of my weakness such as bad time management passive studying poor execution
he has not been exposed to such knowledge before so homework is difficult for him to complete
everyone has his or her own advantages in different aspects so we should assign tasks according to everyones advantages and personality
but i will try my best to complete them
i think my biggest obstacle at present is the language problem
so do a preparation before class is very necessary for me and there are some materials provided for class in our vle
the teacher will attach a reference to the content of the natural resources to prove the accuracy and reliability of the contentthe teacher will also teach some correct reference in the class
i remember it clearly that noel told us that he cant give us the standard answers and the standard answer doesnt exist but we can get the high or even full mark in many different ways
nevertheless the tutors will tell you what students should do and what they should read in a certain period4
maybe a little more will be better
especially some people in our team are not very good at english listening
in facti just focus too much on honesty and integrity when i think about the ethical principle beforebut i never think something more about the respect for environmenti know the importance of environment protection and i think i did it well during the life time in the last but i fail to link it to my worki do not understand clearly about the responsibility required as a engineer before reading the rae ethical principles
be always late or absence from classes 2 dont do homework3
in addition people have different priorities to deal with things for team members from different cultures because of different work and life concepts
be good at group study7
communication is the main difference in our team
i think it is a important habit to be succeededon the other hand one of my group mate never come to class
if your team is not reliable then the result will be unpredictable and often disappointingteam playerfor effective collaboration to occur every person involved needs to be a team player who is focused on reaching a common goalconflict resolutionit is important to engage in conflict resolution productively authenticityit means that the ability to be authentic and true to one  s self it is an important skill to have when collaborating within a team
i also learned before the class but the content of the study is very different
for example at the last international business lecture john asked us to act as people from different background some students they are too shy to show themselves totally
so i need to perclass preparation and careful review after class to better understand what i have learned in class
as for weaknesses i think their opinions or views sometimes are a little childish
each and every collaborator has to have the skill of being consistent and being reliable
and i will participate in group discussions as often as possible
so i think i need to change and must try my best to compete my master degreeexpect i expected before in master degree students need to have more autonomy and space to follow their study plan and to do some research by themselves
for example when i am sitting in the classroom and listening to lecturers presentations my attention could not completely focused on the lecturers
im very happy with the induction programme because i come too late in sep and i dont have any friends here
however i can see that these session may have been more useful for student from other universities or those that have not studied recently
team learning helps improve the core competence of the team
the lecturers will involve some funny jokes and funny stories as examples in the opening or lecture content
for example they dont accept the parents commandto learn even if they knew that learning is the right thing they are notwilling to do it
in the past our homeworkmight be specific exercises but now it is some open questions to express ouropinions freely6
as for the financial part we can learn some knowledge of accounting
the professor wasthe moderator
because this is my fifth year of studying in a foreign country so i have fully adapted to learning and living in a strange environment
for example some of us have learned relevant knowledge about engineering marketing skills and business skill
i always make it a point to make sure i mark the important concepts as and when the professor discusses the concepts in examination point of view so that i can concentrate more on that topic while preparing for my examinations or essay course works
he believes that business is closely related to different cultural backgrounds because culture is a basic behaviour and logic of people
our lectures include basic course knowledge focus and expand some extracurricular content
all lecturers have eye contract with us all the lecture they sometimes will come down to the stages and talk with us friendly
i found many classmates are learned in the different major during their undergraduate studies it means we have specialized knowledge in our own area and we can learn a lot from each other
ninth in the past the university library was not open 24 hours a day most of the time it opened at 6 am and closed at 10 pm
maybe in future we will face how to change our ideas to be the samei will use date and facts to convince my team members that which one is the best ideaand i also can accept other peoples ideas if they are useful for our team
where do you studydo you like to study alone or with friends
i think it might because i have too much homework or group work to do and i realized that the grade is quite important for me to finding a job i am more initiate in my study5
their presentation skills and maybe try and use some of their humor skills as well
am you need a good leader to assign work
im a student have a bachelor degree in china so its a totally new study life for me in the uk
there is the only problem is we always communicate in chinese
the teaching style is different from the past but i like it actually
maybe thesefactors are the reasons that lead to the unsuccessful collaborative learning ithink
smoothvoice i think when people do presentations they need to use smooth voice inorder to make your audience listen clearly2
only in the strict and orderly collective organization and with the efficient teamwork can achieve success in collaborative learning and we should use the unity cooperation to overcome difficulties or even create a miracle
no complaints about the delivery of lectures here
this requires us to improve our time management and selfcontrol10
you have distinct preference of extraversion over introversion 72you have slight preference of intuition over sensing 22you have moderate preference of thinking over feeling 53you have distinct preference of judging over perceiving 62
i went to the kitchen to make dinner for myselfafter eating i watched my favorite anime for relaxing
i have gained that in the collaborative learning everyone should pay attention on what task you have been allocated
in addition they will provide enough examples to explain each new knowledge to the students
in the case of dse class i think that each slide is very clear and very attractive to me
the problem is that workers do not have any relevant certificateshoweveri am not against him
but it takes a lot of time and affect my listening
first of all i mustchange my style of learning
collaborators conduct positive andnegative discussions around learning objectives that could further develop thecritical thinkingoverallcollaborative learning will play an important role in my academic life
in china most of the teachers are strict
today i  m going to analyze some of the reflections on my learning problems during my threemonth study abroad
for example many excellent students spend most of their time on study while i may spend my time on other things
i will analyze bothpersonal and teamfor thepersonal aspect
i will be much more experienced as a leader in a group
to be honest taking notes efficiently is a little difficult to me because i can not catch the key part in classes quickly
finally i decided to write down some key words
because my notes are not fast enough and my ability to find keywords is not so accurate
most team members are aboutthe same age like me young and energetic
before i can get this achievement there is still a long way for me
we could have an efficient teamwork
to be a person who has the courage to express himself to cultivate confidence and dare to try4
therefore it will reduce the team efficiencyabout asking for help encounter difficulties or seek cooperation are possible situations
there are three factors that i have learnt from our lectures and i will practice practicepracticefirst of all logical lecture is really really really important
i will organize the group meeting more regularly and hold some parties sometimes3
i think the law for engineering management is well designed
actually i was really happy to share my problems with you everyone has a bottleneck period to spend and everyone has to overcome some difficulties it is normal to have a break time to take a breath from your busy study but do not indulge yourself you need to know the direction and try hard to reach the destination
the difference in personality of team members is the most important factor
lacking of communication between classmates surprise me
ideas must be written in white board or in anotherplace so that everybody could see
i think that for successful collaborative learning mutual understanding mutual strength and collaborative spirit are all essential
by collaborative learning we could avoid some mistakes together and discuss the problem which we meet in modules
all lecturer deliver their lecture very clearly even for me
this is the meaning of teamwork
in addition the team members need to communicate effectively
to my surprise it was raining heavily and still dark outsidesi even cant hail a taxi because of the bad weatherten minute later i waited for a taxii told the driver to drive as fast as possiblebut because of the heavy rainthere was a serious traffic jams i became very anxious and yelled at the driver to drive faster but he told me there was nothing he can do about itso i called my classmates and told her i was afraid i would be latei was very sorry about thatthey just told me that took it easy and paid attention to traffic safetywhen i got thereit was already close to 7：10 am
class most students come from different countries and different academic backgrounds different module also have different professional backgrounds of students to participate in such as artificial intelligence of students and share with us the data communication engineering management students and other subjects we share most of the students academic background is similar to that of computer science but also has a business background of students joined our department
cooperative skills are important too when i am a member of a team
to be a distinction grade student i have to overcome these shortcomings and become more competitive not only in the following time of my postgraduate course but also in my future life
and this is not related with the time but in thecontent of the class
as i mentioned in the previous question1less patience2negative attitude 3poor sense of duty for the team
because we are just students so we will be lack of professional knowledge so selflearning behavior skill will be very useful
it also takes me much time and energy
by the way i plan to come back to china to treat my tooth and so on
yeschallenges it is likely to be hard to keep my knowledge and skills up to date sometimesmany people including me usually are satisfied with current situation
because in my past study i always use chinese to understand thecourse contents
8
from the way of teamwork learning i learned from teamwork how to fully cooperate and share in different cultural backgrounds
i would say that the most essential one by far is communication
i have communicated with the previous students for my problem and i got the reply from them which is quite useful for my future studytherefore the induction part should be passed on to the next group of students
in cooperation everyone promotes each other and learns each other while improving the efficiency of personal learning
first of all the form of class is different
i usually finish the notes
every teacher is a very good example
in addition thislearning method is often used in future work and i think we can learnimportant skills in this process
to make the total teaching process more funny they usually created some interaction procedure to help us get involved into specific situation to help us understand some theory or terminologies with deep impression
i know that this is not good but it is always difficult to overcomemy ability to concentrate is not very good
besides living environment are different
and every class we have fixed mission if we always ask the questions the tasks can not be finished
i think i have done some events to copingwith the academic work
in the context of international cooperation efficient team learning can be a challenge but i see it more as a growth for me
i expect i can improved not only my professional knowledge but also my english level
the structure of our lecture lesson covers the introduction of the topic body content and conclusion
but our group had some questions in our plan
then they spend time on discussing and learn nothing
i was used to scheduling small plans and doing short timemanagement
the summary of other peoples views also has a corresponding basis
yorks courses are not only professional learning but also growth in other aspects
at the same time knowledge is easy to accept
they can help me to learn more knowledge from different aspect
such as the way or model of others work the attitude of work and the way of distributed work etc
finally of course it is necessary to keep practicing and mature speakers can become comfortable with each lecture only through constant practice
i think thats one of the reasons why a lot of lecturers like powerpoint
we need some sacrificeand its important to create an active atmosphere in a groupeveryone are willing to express their ideasand everyone want to take part in teamwork
after alejandro also examined it improved a fewfinally with these two modifications weifan and yifan improved our cash flowfinally the result was a realistic cash flow
if the questions the can not answer right now they will answer them in other time
in terms of personal ability the language learning ability and teamwork ability have been further improved and the difficulties in the project can be solved by themselvesthe difference between my first degree and the msc at york 1
china attaches great importance to its major in professional learning
the experience in group study makes me realize the importance of teamwork
and the asterisk means something is very important in this course
yes i think i can follow these rules
after each theoretical course is finished i will take a practical course and use the knowledge learned in the previous lesson to consolidate and apply it through experimental courses
t i can be and contribute to the team
although there are some difficulties in communication the differences in culture between different countries are also the diversity of our learning
it need a lotof practice and timesecond lack of experience and knowledge about thetopic which is discussed
yes i could hear clearlyyes the slides were clearyes there were good interaction between students and lecturersno they didnt have
although sometimes quarreling we calm down and think about how to solve problems after quarreling instead of glimpsing quarrel
that way you get good grades and get more time to do more tasks
the knowledge taught by this class is useful for our report writing and assignment
i find out that each people have different skills and all friendly to everybody
to be honest that is really limited
there were many important things that i have not said
they often ask for more money from their boss which is contrary to the honesty principle
so in most cases i can understand my notes
to be honest i very much hope to reach a distinction grade student but i also know that it takes a lot of effort to achieve this result because the competition is very difficult and very difficult
the slides are very simple and clear and i can understand them clearlyin addition the lecturers always listen to us and look at us with eyetoeye contacting
i am a teamworker completer and finisher
if your teammates are so huge and strong ability you might think i dont want to be the stumbling block
i may understand what the lecturer talked and conveyed but i didn  t absorb these contents into my own knowledge
it is higher than my expected
humor in the speech is to attract the attention of the audience to ensure that the audience does not feel that the theme is boring
moreover the student can interrupt the teacher when we have some questiones
this programme changed my thoughts about study because the programme needs a clear plan and spirit of teamwork who can be a leader who needs to operate and who can organize all of thoughts
when i was coursing my previous degree in my timetable i just had module slots but without differentiating labs and lectures and in the majority of the cases the classes were all lectures and in some modules we had just practical sessions but without background theory
one of the classmates didn  t like to write homework just wanted to be lazy so many students hated him
and in the class the teacher willask us whether we have read these materials
i think these may be potential tests
if possible look for ateacher as a supervisor to supervise the outcome of the studysecondlystrictly develop learning programs
in the two months i studied in york i felt like i was having a full and challenging time
tw i think i am always a mild and sociable person
i believe this attitude can work if many chances have been given to the person that is a hinderance and the problem has been identified and is unsolvable without getting rid of that person
as mentioned above for some students taking many notes that they can reference back to will help with their intake of the lectures
i think i learned a lot in the induction week and had a comprehensive understanding of the next course
to some peoplethey may be outgoinghoweverto another peoplethey may be shyif someone would like to accept other opinion and adviceit is not a diffcult thing to change themself
when i go back to my dormitoryafter these activities i will feel really down and exhausted and won  t bewilling to do anything related to academic and only want to do something forfun then go to bed
in china our class is very fixed
it is also important to give appropriate work
yes i do aspire to be a distinction grade student and i intend to do this by staying on top of work and completing it as i get it rather than procrastinating
though some of the interaction in the larger joint msc lectures felt a bit forced
actually a good living schedule can bring lots of benefits i feel the clear brain better for my body health and not struggling with late for date
therefore i treat the academic work assigned by tutor seriously because i know my final results related to the homework
the program integrate a module for personal effectiveness during the course and beyond career
yes i am very satisfy and i am really hopeful at the end we will end this course with a lot of knowledge
yes of course they can their delivery is really wonderful each of the lecturers can have eyes contact with all of us as well as great body language
each lesson is one hour mostly while classes aretwo hours in my college which is too long
positive interaction with classmates also adds to the atmosphere of the classroom
they were very confident and their voices were clear
on the other hand i have to admit that exchanging ideas can foster creativity and collect everyones strength together in a task
they have many good ideas which are different with me
in the meantime they will use video pictures and other means to help us understand easily in a way that uses practical examples in production and life
so we should do more practice before giving the presentationbesides teachers always do the interaction with us and the eye contact can be found anytime
every time when i used mind mapping i do not have enough space to write those words
but the lecturer will show some examples every lecture so it is very important to take notes to know how to deal with those questions
in the past we just learn many theory but did not know how to use it in practical
later i started to learn how to refuse and i realized that although we didn  t do everything together we are still friends
sometimesi find that our group members will deviate from the assignment theme
i think its too early to know it but it seems to be fine yes
for example when there are important things in my family and at the same time the work is also in a hurry i may prefer to deal with the things at home and ignore the urgent work which will affect the work benefits
we should have stopped playing games to continue our study
in order to solve these problems i need to incorporate english learning into my own study plan increase my own word volume and reading level consciously communicate with foreign friends and finally strive to turn disadvantages into my own advantages
i think that is the main difference that we chinese people so care about the answer is right or wrong that we are not brave enough to answer the questions teacher asked
my speech was very fluid and i was full of confidence
i can finish the homework assigned by the teacher in time listen carefully to the class never leave the group discussion be able to give my own opinions and actively complete the work that the group is responsible fori am of course eager to be a good studentbut i am sure there are still a lot of bad places to do to hinder my successfirst of all i am not a very active student
for the first time i live and study in the uk alone3
without mutual communication and learning the purpose of cooperative learning can not be achieved
i think it may be related to the work habits of the team members
geert hofstede the 5d model of national culture
maybe i will play the role as monitor evaluator as the result said i think it is correct
it lets me understand the cultural differences
whats more after class i get used to reviewing the notes and doing a summary about those notes
i feel that life in york is more adaptable than at the beginning
i am going to list twelve differences among msc in imand my university of peru
this is a problem that we need to solve in the futurei think that when my thoughts are in the early stages my members will push me to think deeplyi think my execution is a good factor in the group
because it will help me to present the content to the audience more intuitively and effectively
for example i just blindly read books and study
so that you can see these ideas for yourself
i will know them deeply based on these questionnaire results so that i can know how should i do in the future for keeping group harmony
i will list them
for example in theparliament where there are a lot of debate
i think the teaching style is clearly to me
these concepts are also broken up with activities for the class to complete with each other which allows for further and deeper engagement with those concepts
then tell us about foundations of branding
main course starts next week so still don t know whats gon na happened but so far so good
on the other hand i am very interested in the diverse ways of class in the uk there are lectures seminars team worksetc
i think that the advantages of these two roles treating others equally as well as respectfully and objective evaluating ideas of the pros and cons are more important in the future teamwork
unconsciously i have been in york for more than three months and my life is extremely rich and colorful
some classmates also make notes on their slide like me of coursecommunicating with students eyetoeye is common in our classes
however the curriculum itself is very abstract and it is not easy to explain with specific objective things
well to be honest as most of my teammates are from china we have similar cultural backgrounds and we obey similar rules and habits in our team working
i live in the outside of the campus and ineed to cook or live by myself which help me live independently and learn howto look after myself
languages i will practice english as much as possible here because english is not good
time content and the structure are all delivered well in each lecture
because only after all the members have the same pursuit everyone can keep in sync
first of all the contents of the teachers lectures are very clear
our lectures are designed reasonably and interesting
in this regard my family and domestic friends give me a lot of support
for the first reason the team members are not united and they lack a common sense to complete the group worksecond some people can not tolerate the opinions of others on his proposalthird an unfriendly group atmosphere can affect the mood of the entire group leading to collaboration failurefinally the team lacks a leader role and no one guides the direction
yes i think there has a lot of different between the uk and china in teaching style
i concern about whether i can fit the new teaching style and master the course
i dont have any concern about the year ahead so far
i believe next time i could do pre better than now
in my opinion if i have strong belief to achieve my goals i will work hard and access to success
i insist that if we devote ourselves to learning we can get more things return
yes i think the teaching style will inspire my thinking and i can learn different skill that i dont have
its not a right time to let me do that or that means i have not the ability for the balance of study and habits now
in the middle of the week because of curriculum reasons different learning tasks can be arranged everyday
i think these problems may always happen in the future i need to know how to solve these differences in my group
yes i have read the ethics engineering and know what the consequences of violating it are
less individual work and more group work individual work and less group work4
some lecturer used the powerpoint in lecture but some use the word document
the differences in ability will make the group tasks that require multiple ablities easier
iwill try my best to finish that part
i think the benefits of group collaboration are as follows：1 improve supervision through study groups
our supervision group is very creative and innovative with a lot of different people coming from the different city of china
the lecturers told the contents clearly and fluently
i need to forcus on the lecture clearly such as taking notes specifically
it is timewasted
this is also the case within lecturers where content follows a logical order with each slide building on the knowledge of the previous slides
i want to enrich myself in spiritual level as well as the academic fieldfrom week1 i have prepared for all the lectures in advance using powerpoint and reading lists
and i do think this is one of the bad habits for me this bad habit may prevent me to get the distinctionadditionally as i have recognised i am a student who lack the ability of creative
in uk the first step is selfthinking and then change the opinions8critical thinking
i hope that the teaching style can be more relaxed
well the first answer came up my mind isthe course law for engineering management
some of them have learned engineering area before so it will be an excellent opportunity for me to learn from them
this will make me confident and my speech will be fluent
it is quite difficult to keep the principles every timethere are many temptations at work but i will do all i can to keep my conscience clear and my heart intact
the accommodation determines the relationship in students
personally i think the main difference during our team work is our different education background
this i did by constant realization of the primary objective of my being in york and studying at the university
i think the afternoon sessions helped me to know about our major our courses it is very helpful and build a paper tower is very impressive
lecturers always use some famous companies to be the example
sometimes i have my own opinions but i dont want to put forward my own opinions because of poor speaking
but here most work and assignments are group work so i need to always organise group talk every week to keep the process of the project3
my cooking skill is better than beforebecause everyday i will cook by myself10i become liking chips and hot chocolate which i didnt like before
studying in york is also very different from my college life
there are some good tips i can study from the lecturerlogicality lecturer attach improtance to the order of classlink such asmove on to ethand gesture it can give people a comfortable feeling and attract people attentioninteractionlecturers often contact with students adn sometimes contact with eye
every teacher answer the question in aspects and give some points i need to consider further on
before professional teachers for homework and other formats are not very important and for reference and so on do not have stringent requirements
yesthe teaching style is more interesting and students can get involved with the course
as all the professors have their own outline about the subjects they can make the lecture very logical and clearly
therefore we should work really hard to pass each exam especially for our foreigners with language obstaclessixthly we dont have the record for the class in china
i am in group 15 and i only saw two members
the second one is that i need to use some methods to make the audiences understand me easily such as body language and visual tools
everyone has the chance to exercise themselves
in terms the academic level of the material being covered i have found that i am understanding all areas very well
the classrooms in china and the uk are almost the same and are well equipped with multimedia
team members ‘ conflict2
all of them are friendly and patient
mindmap needs time to be gradually grasped
the most challenging thing for me is language barrierto solve this problemi plan to learn more english and communicate with others
there are many corporate lecturers paying more attention to practical applications10
there is a lot more time for discussionwith the team members10 diverse teaching styles
they usually have some different ways on thinking about the question
if they hear clearly they will repeat the questions loudly with their classmates so that other students can understand the problemthen they will analyze the questions explain them give reasons and answer them in combination with what they have learned in class
besides almost all teachers use courseware to let student understand deeply
if time is limited or the problem needs to be discussed in depth the teacher will continue to explain under the class
list 10 differences msc in em my first degreeelectronic engineering1 more lectures no labs lectures and labs2
time flies and the introduction meeting at the beginning is the most impressive one
there are no exams on this course so possible test questions do not need to be indicated
i have to learn to cook by myself because i have not been used to the dietary habit here3
thats why i need to have notes about such little but very important things
i feel that if teamwork failsthe first reason may be that communication is insufficient communication in teamwork is an important issue and secondly it may be because everyone has insufficient professional ability
when the test results are not ideal i will not be depressed actively looking for my own problems and then study hard for the next test
by contrast list skill is quite easy to use when the lecturer processing i can list the order and logic
some tutors will have some humorous ways to help us understandmy favorite lecture is marketing by doctor bidyut why i really like the lecture because his lecture have strong structure i can follow him he always give us more specific example like more different company
everyday is full of studying9
furthermore i realized the significance of team work when i participated two team work activities
therefore it takes more time for students to understand the knowledge and solve and solve some problems
you can also show your understanding and unique ideas and receive inspiration from others
yes it is similar with what i take in beng course
i am worried about my reading and writing report a little
it is also because my problem often makes me think that there are still tasks that are not completed when i am entertaining
if there are too many group members have same character it may cause contradiction between them because they focus on the same point and may have different opinions which may influence the atmosphereand the performance of the team
there is no denying that distinction students arequite respectable they have gained a good point in their works and they aresuccessful
i often enlarge the difficulty and feel that i cant overcome it but in fact many at the time i will solve the problem smoothly with the encouragement of others
in the specification he focused on the typical models of differences
so we take the notes during this period he also make some examples or funny story to make difficult concepts easy to understand
for example in the class of international business john often starts his lecture with some interesting stories
i think it will help us improve ourselves together
hopefully during our future classes more interactions can be used
as one of the youngest student in the group many of them have much more working or studying experience than me
pronunciation speed of speech lecture style
sorry but i cant think out some situations or actions are contrary to the rae ethical principles
therefore its very important to review them periodically
this is better way of teaching that i had in previous years
i think the most important factor is ability to cooperate with others because the main meaning of collaborative learning is divide the difficult and complex work into different small part then everyone in the group will focus on one part which is his strength
though i lead the two group activities my group members surpport me a lot
if i don not do preview，it will be difficult for me to follow the lecture4homework in here need more language skillsin china my homework were calculation questions5
i find that there are several reasons which could affect our team work
yes surely
the group is filled with the one who gives the ideas the other who takes forward the ideaconcept and takes it to a new level the one who supports the entire technical and analytical aspects of the plan and with me in the group i can do a good monitoring and reflective thinking about the idea
sometimes i dont understand what terms the lecturers are talking about the well designed slides will help me comprehend meanings
but just now i would try my best to meet my academic goal by different waysmy subject is embedded wireless systemwhat is i never touched before
his slides were clear
i expected the interesting teaching style which can make me feel funny
in addition lecturers use pictures or brief video to help listeners better understand the content
in the next year we should help each other and one should set the aimothers should work hardly to reach the aim
miscommunicationsome people do more work than otherslanguage barrier
finally give the conclusionas well as the humour can make the lecture more interesting
we always play the same character in our team and do the same work
this includes but is not limited to accepting bribes and kickbacks copyrights trademarks and trade secrets information privacy internal ease giving or receiving remuneration work harassment environmental protection occupational health and safety misleading or misleading financial information or misuse of company property law
the most important thing in the groups cooperation is mutual understanding and trust
in my daily courses actually i just sometimes take notes
very good
i think my group is not good at communication
before i came to york there was a set of engineering ethics and legal system in china but it did not popularize education well in university
if we have different opinion next time we can find more evidence to support our opinion and persuade our colleagues
i think the lecture is okey very good
but at leastthe minimum that i expect is to offer some commitment to achieve the commongoal
it also let me know exactly what i will learn and do in this academic year what i will gain from this programmei think the tower competition is most helpful
the msc does encourage and require more independent study and interest that would be expected on an undergraduate course however this is something that i developed and became used to during the final year of my undergraduate study
for the last question during me observed all my lecturers did not use the notes
if i have any question they will give me a clear answer and they always help me actively
may i can be inclined to clash with shapers due to their contrasting management styles and be a useful guy to have in charge of our team with diverse skills
the body language could be study from lecturer because it is hard for every new lecturer to do some body languages in their lecture
feedback is the most important way to communicate with the university education at present im satisfied with this form
as a international student language is one of the problem occurs to me
i think that because most of the students in em are chinese the logic of chinese students and the british students are still slightly different
in addition to that ethical or political opinions should be avoided
less course schedule per day
if they mention some points there would several example occur to us
for example sometimes i can not communicate well with others especially when discussing in groups
it shows knowledge and background in what is being presented
for example i have learnt how to do a public speaking and know the way to explain the point which i want to let the audience understand
i will concentrate on the lectures and wont waste time anymore
first i think all the group members shouldbe allowed to share their idea and they should be willing to share
exams
i think there is one or two knowledge points on the slide and increase the slide
in international business class johns language is very humour that made the emotion relaxed
yes the induction programme introduces us about how we will have lessons in the next year and also what we will learn and practice the theoretical knowledge into real life
even though there are still some differences between each other because we are from different parts of china
although i know that thereis a study plan i still promised my friends to join the party
only if everyone in the group work hard the collaborative learning could be successful
my preparation was not enough
but i can not understand very wellbecause lunch is the most important food for me and i have to eat something that i like during noon
they usually use a single word or short sentence to sum up the entire speech which gives a clear idea of their subject
i think it is a challenge for me to adapt a new teaching style but i really expect to participate in new class also have some totally different experiences compare with past
if i have to compete i would never think i have to be first
its hard to judge things like their quality of work or willingness to collaborate on group work this early however as ive mentioned before a great deal of them seem friendly and sociable and i feel like a good sense of camaraderie is key to stay motivated
studying a master is a goalbut is not only to come a university and attend the lectures
the professional lawyers seldom use humour into the class but the class taught by them is logical
multilearning includes extracurricular reading and literature search
it is essential for lecturers to keep ones attention by doing some demos interact with the audience and use humour when needed
very patient and professional
im a punctual personbut there is one situation i cant forget i want to talk aboutwhen i was the fourth year at universityour tutor selected two students to go to another city to take part in a academic communication seminar
but in our period of study especially for the course of law the social elites are invited to our class to share some practical experience with us
in ordinary learning education teachers are the main position which also makes many people lack the ability of independent learning and independent thinking lack of personalized opinions and ideas that can not be expressed
we should try to appreciate the strength of other members in the group rather than trying to find the drawbacks of them
firstly before starting to work it is important to a good conversation with your fellow teammates
in the class of internal business the teacher made an impressive effort in setting the class coherence and logic and the use of humour is also suitable
we can replay the record again if we can not understand the content of the class thats considerate for our foreigners with language obstaclesseventhly we seldom do the presentation in china
management engineering7
and the other reason is that my hand writing is every big
but in fact i think that i can balance my life and study for now
an hour later i received a message from the roommates who wanted to go out and buy halloween decorations to dress up our dormitory
market analysis is available but there is a lack of practice in personal career planning or entrepreneurship planning
i will actively communicate with them and listen to their opinions andshare mine
i think this will come true
he always answers my question directly and gives some suggestions to me
well in my opinion the similarities in the personality will help the member of the group to solve problems in a same pattern
i believe all of these problems could be solved as if i put myefforts on it
i think i can handle the academic work well in this year
firstly form of homework are different
it is the programme that i was looking for
to be honest i didnt ask them questions for many times
this would include being able to point out what others might have missed or where they might be wrong as well as being able to be told these yourself and being able to share what have you learned clearly and concisely
their strengths are patience and nice while the weaknesses are lack of leadership and too many questions
for me i dont think it is difficult because i regard it as a new challenge
i cant figure out where i am doing badly
the lecturer manages to get through a lot of content while managing to make it digestible as well as having a great sense of humour
as long as a group is capable of engaging one another keeping details up to date and highlighting what has happenedwhat went wrongwhat needs to be done collaborative learning will improve
thereforesome thoughts can  t be shared in time and eventually fade away
humour and jokes will be an excellent start for the whole lecture
the teacher of each class will give a reading list some are some paper to read and some are books
sometime i focus too much on what i am going to say so i tend not to pay attention to others
if you have to consult a dictionary if you dont know a word you wont be able to read it effectively
because every teacher will prepare lessons well before class so will be able to perform in class
the punchlines they used in the lecture made it not only more intersting but also moving from one point ot the next smoothly
the class is small 25m2 adopted acoustically – very well speech understanding screen for presentations is big enough the slides are prepared very well
an amazing day is full and meaningful but often the reality is wow
there could be a clash of personalities in the future
although i know my teachers and classmates are very friendly and they dont laugh at me when i make some mistakes i can not feel comfortable and fluency at present
i sometimes go back to lecture capture to complete note taking
eachmember must actively look for information for the team goal of struggle inorder to make the team complete the goal as soon as possible
first of all lecturer describ your question wheather is good and give you a right direction
this really shock me because i always have everythingdown and get my grades before vacation so i can really enjoy it
the notes written in this way are very intuitive and easy to review again
i will pay more attention to my logicality in the future presentationsecondly body languages and contacting eyetoeye are also necessary i mean interaction
this is very useful for me because i can be more impressed
therefore the leader is important and can be called the core of the teammost importantly everyone in the group should donate their own power for the whole group
it can not beignored that some students are relearn after they werethe employee
when the teacher issued the task in class everyone was willing to cooperate and get along with each other very happilyi am looking forward to answering the teachers questions more actively and boldly in the future class time and having academic communication with the teacher in class instead of being so shy that i just listen to the teachers explanation in class and dare not express my own opinions
after this series of meetings i probably had a framework for studying here but later on the beginning of the course proved that my idea was relatively simple and challenging to realiseafter the start of the course education mode of york university is different from education mode of most chinese universities which is mainly reflected in autonomy and resource provision
i was surprised how constructed the tower by paper to weight a orange
these are my 2 biggest problem which could affect my efficiency lazy and unfocused
i really enjoy the process of studying in york and i obtained a lot of advanced knowledge and theory about managementin addition i have learnt a lot of thinking and academic style which is different from my own countriesdifferences between my first degree and the msc in em1、my first degree is civil engineering which is more about technology and design rulesthe msc in em here is more about management theory2、first degree require more logic thinking，em require more comprehensive thinking 3、first degree is mainly about construction engineeringem is referred to broader scale 4 、em here in york concentrate more on the group work than my first degree 5、first degree require more laboratoriesem require more research and survey6、first degree belongs to natural scienceem belongs to social science 7、em in york highlight more evidence to support opinion and report 8、first degree last assignment is design workem in york last assignment is report9、em in york has more interaction and practice in classes 10、em in york has more practical cases in class to show the definition of some key and important concept
sometimes there maybe have something that i have misunderstood myself and i dont know yet
at this time if someone asks me about that i may have misleading others inadvertently
the style of lecturers who teach us by using humorous way
in the lecture the teacher will explain the contents of the slides
gradually i became bored at playing computergames
for example shadow of tomb raider the first day i buy it i take 5hours to play it at night
however my group members all tell me that i do not need to be worry
mostly
i almost never think about doing it early i always rushed to complete before i dragged it to the deadline
but i still found it is difficult for me to keep up with the tutor even i have preview the course the jargon cant be understand without dictionary
the key lies in the user3 readingchinese universities will provide some materials that need to be referred to but they will not give any specific lists of books to be read
and we all satisfiedwith itsecond all the members should take part inthe group activities
noting down some points helps me reflect on what i have written and also helps me thing of why i have written what i have written
now i can make sure every assignment finished on time and keep records on the reading list
the learning here is mainly based on practice and research
that is something that i am always learning
i think it could be little earlier
logical slides7
different culture has their unique feature
also the slides are very clear
in the past i was taught in the first language and the teaching style was quite simple and regular
lectures were very strict in logic and lecturers were very humorous because they often would like to use some funny examples or stories to help us to understand what they said
at the same time it is a great thing to listen carefully be brave in expressing and comment on the team members
it will make people overestimate themselves
skill because it has been several years last time i studied mathematics
moreover tutor always asked us that do we have question they will answer the question in the lecture or after the lecture
coming from a country that is not having english as my native language would only help us if we try and interact with the other students in our class
in britain many assignments or tasks need to be done in groups
i think this will affect our attention which may lead us to miss some knowledge
finally we cleared up our ideas with differentpoints of view
it flowed logically the lecturer is full of a sense of humor and i never feel ambiguous about the switch of the points
in order to other members can beconvinced about their ideas was wrong
i found the afternoon sessions personally a bit repetitive in terms of how to reference etc as ive done my undergrad in this country and am aware of it
most of these research evidences are cited in rigorous academic articles or data analysis is used to prove the results of the research
then i finish the homework assigned by the teacheryes i want to be a distinction reading habits
it was a strong change in my mindset
i think i have changed a lot
personallyi think the lectures were delivered very welli can clearly hear and understand what the lecturers saidthe slides were always clearif i didt catch the lecturersi would look at the slides that can help understand what the lecturers saidthey didt use notes in the lectures
in the uk most of them focus on the practical operation
this task taught me how to team work and help the member of my team
so i watched tv shows and readnovels every day i did not want to write my homework
all lecturers used relevant slides and software took questions which is extremely helpful and used notes to explain certain concepts
i prefer the lecture for teaching us how to write essay
this year is the third year of my fitness
i usually take notes about the points of slides using internet before the lecture which let me be familiar with the content of class
i think they should choose themost relevant sources first
the advantage of this is that we can better accept it
for example i need search a teacher to apple my future study in my interesting area
to study the advantage of others and to make up my deficiency depending on others superiorities
do you think it will be what you expected
the powerpoint is not very long for each lecture
ivcompletion of term 1 week 5 logcompletion of term 1 week 5 log
at last keep together and work hard together it will lead us to get a great progress
the topic that the lecturer wants to address today will choose a wide range of headlines and then set the main point of view and indepth theme by the headline
during these 7 weeks i have been changed my taking notes habit i would like to write down the key words instead of the whole sentencei would like to use pens with different colors and different icons to show the level of significance for example i am keen on using the star icon to represent the title of the lecture and use red pen to circle the key pointi would like to pay more attention on the part which teacher spend more time on since i think it will be the test question partyes i can understand my notes and if i have some confusion about my notes i will review the video of our lectures to help me catch up
the other students in my supervision group are good at english language skill but they seem not very good at ee
bidyut always tell the small jokes and he can be judged as humourous
active and friendly atmosphere can make members willing to participate in group activities and be willing to contribute to the group、3
however there are some obstructs to prevent me to be a distinction grade student and overcoming them will be my next goalfirstly the idleness is a big obstruct in the way of becoming distinction grade student
i normally take notes on my surface pro by downloading the slideshow onto notebook and making notes around each slides
some of the following is a repeat of what you have said before so that your supervisor sees a bigger picture of you and what you want to get out of the mscreflecting on the teaching you have observed what are their good points and what did you not like
the teaching style is similar to what i expected
identify the purpose and objectives consider the audience organize the structure and content eye contact hand gestures using space movement facial expressions dress and appearance voice using objects and technology using prompts practise
overall i lost about 4 to 5 hours to do something relatedto academic only because i can  t find a good way to relieve the pressure andcan  t control and manage myself well
however i certainly believe i can abide those regulations no matter what challenges i meet
especially in the enterprise course i have never been exposed to a project that creates a company model explicitly
actually i have been to york for four month cause i took the language course two months ago
as a result i onlycompleted the blog assignment on fridayi went tothe supermarket on saturday and bought some ingredients which planned to bringto my friends house on sunday
lectures find the best case for the main point
5the teaching environment in the uk is more flexible
few students are trying really hard to put in their best foot forward
therefore i believe that this week can meet my expectation
however in my job as resident engineer i could seecontractsstrategic management is not a little novelty to me because i assisted somesmall course where i learned the basic things of strategy management
this could also happen if i went over to a university friends accommodation or if they come over and we have the intention of revising or doing group work during my undergraduate studies
when we had discussion he was absent i have never consider this phenomenon
there are a lot of professional knowledge theory among the course i should spend a lot of time on understanding them after the lectures
i tried to just write down the key words and i found it is time saving as well as useful
i am not satisfied with my listenning and speaking
for example there is at least one person who has leadership ability
the rebellious teenagers bravely resisted but usedthe wrong way
for me i come to study abroad facing the knowledge of different languages and many unfamiliar fields
on the one hand i met teachers who are very responsible and friendly
besides the marketing part will teach us about the technique of marketing and how can we widen the market
the teacher always encouraged us to ask questions and i think its a good way to really understand the knowledge we learned in class
7there are sports cad drawing courses in my undergraduate in china
i am always be late about 1 or 2 minutes
everyone would seriously consider the ideas of others and be patientsecondly i am not actually a serious and meticulous person but one of my team members is very strict and serious
because different people have differentsituation
because i thought that i would be on a familiar surrounding but i would like to practice my english
if i lead a good team this can learn to grow up with each other
the only problem we had was that the first weeks the whiteboard pens were empty and frank was always trying to paint without success now we have new pens and thus the problem is resolved
for example we have four options of products and we select one of the products but after asking the advice from noel we change our productstrategy management north is pretty accessible the smile can always be found from her face
hard to say how much risksrises after this kind of rush but what  s more important is it broke our protocolsand regulationsanother case i can think of is when i wasdoing some road show i might use some tailored data and information
everyone have own merits and demerits we can complement each others
that is to say postgraduate courses require the higher ability of independent learning
for some of difficult knowledge points they should think whether they need to be demonstrated by other relevant video or demonstrated by the form of experiments
every student wants to get a distinction degree not just apass
we have a health test every year
extravert22 intuitive62 thinking22 judging50
this could hinder success as it could lead to explosive arguments and holes in the team whereas that person may have performed better in another role had the been reallocated instead of being thrown out
i am not sure is she preview the class or not but i am really sure that she prepare the class
how to analyze the marketing mix 4ps from a longterm perspective from the future development of the product to the distribution model we have seriously considered and discussed
because this is very boring when the audience is bored they will divert attention
this is because i hope that the complete notes can help me during the review
some people are very cut and dry with there opinions and decisions
i need to be more selfmotivated and think independently no standard answer is given
he likes to have the eye contact with us and wish to do some interaction with uslaw for engineering management due to the course is special our teacher always change
however there are still some cases that i have to take into account
i really want to be a good student
i think my notes are quite easy to recognized at least i can understand easily which is very important
i studied in china for my undergraduate study so the language environment of the courses was different2the examination system is different
i always think that i can search the literatureon the online library system and do something related to the academic in mydorm
there are toomany word in a page and the size of word is too small so i can  t see themvery cleari think most of the ppt are attractive becausethere are many bright pictures and clear roadmaps and structure diagram in them
and due to we have quite different skills so we can cooperate with the others
yesduring the induction weeki feel the level of interaction is just makes me feel take part in the class and not too nervous for be asked all the time
4miscommunication with engineers leads to misunderstandings
problems arise in every groups but we need to overcome those problems
i am still trying to copewith such pace but i wouldn  t know what i am really capable of before themarks for my final assignments come out hopefully i can get a good result
i also want to change another job and i need to get mymaster degree and it would be nice to get a distinction degree
i really enjoyed the pizza party the pizzas and drinks are great but i found that its a little bit hard to start chatting with people who come from different country
i realized that there always someone do better than you and what should i do is keeping promoting and i should always looking for anopportunity to do better and achieve greatness
but i dont know about the other 2 person
pay more attention in1 clear structure for presentation2 great body language eye contact tone speaking speed3 high quality of context4 observe the audience i mean does everyone can understand what i said if they not i need to change a way to explain
for example in my countryside mostpeople wait that two or three people speaks all the time in meeting or thecoordinator resolve the problem
the whole of york is in a strong festive atmosphere
we have really enjoyed our teamtime to chat and to corporative to do the project or even after that we chatted a lot for sharing our life experience
managing better the challenges that will present trying to balance the good and the bad things looking for the teams elements skills and disadvantages
i think i learned a lot of presentation skills in my lecturer
i managed to write the elog here and have already finished the blog assignment
firstly i konw the details of the courses and the teachers
i firmly believethat only my efforts can get what i expect
these students already have a certain level of values and willhave a more comprehensive view of things unlike others who may be onesided intheir thinking
in his lectures she helps me to move to one point to anothereasily
secondly i will selectively record the points mentioned by the lecturer and will not blindly record notes without selection resulting in a reduction in efficiency and unnecessary waste of time and energy
at present i am worried about my spoken
this gives me enough timeto work on grey areas to make it perfecti aspire to be a distinction student as i believe i have thecapabilities to achieve the high grade and work ethic
it is better to put all the
this is good because in theclass students will be more competitivethere are behaviourswill hinder success
because i think it will be useful to help you understand more and maybe you will create some new products
what i think can change is the activity of replacing origami which is a waste of paper even though it improves our teams ability to work
when i give a talk firstly i will identify a clear goal and theme collecting enough relevant materials and references to do a good job of preparation
it helped me to cultivate critical thinking
the activity of building a tower is the most attrativest to mebecause it show our team work ability and know our shortage in it
in the meantime there will be background video on youtube
i think the class is full of enthusiasm for learning and will often organize discussionsi hope this discussion goes on because its good for us to communicate and learn from each other
7 assessments here at the university the assessments arelarger and more structured with very specific requirements to be fulfilled
a good group should have a good leader to lead all the team members to learn and control the general direction without a good leader then this group will always be fragmented unable to focus on cohesion to do the task of the group5 regular meetings to summarise and reflect
when we have questions and ask them they always use their knowledge to help us solve our doubts
and then they need to show some theories cases evidences to hope them to explain these theories clearly
body language speed of speech and changes in intonation are all important and we can learn more by watching different speakers as they talk about their priorities
sometimes i lack selfdiscipline this might hinder me to get a distinction degree
team learning can give full play to the individual comparative advantages of the team members to achieve mutual assistance within the team
independently studyin chinateachers tell you most things i seldom to study extra leanings
because last year experienced a year of preparatory courses education a lot of professional knowledge has been used for a long time
most of the slides are very clear and concise allowing the audience to see the key points of the entire slide in the first place
there are always people in the group who are not highly motivated to learn
furthermore jackson helps meto move to one point to another easilytony ward flows logically in his lectures
after a period of time i was glad that my reading ability improved
in addition as a lecturer i need to check my content at the audiences angle
i believe that time management is a big challenge in my learning processtime is fair we have 24 hours a day it depends on how you control the 24 hours
now i can see which it is important idea and i feel that myprogress is little best that before
when the amt programme started i tried to do some reading before lectures
the heading is the key point or a question
bb i have asked bb about the differences between marketing mods and 4ps
he or she is supporting well their ideasmoreover critical thinking gives us the opportunity to evaluate the problemfrom different perspectives
independent thinkingunderstanding the teachers lecture and have their own opinions and ideas3
if everyone insists on their own opinions and refuses to make concessions it will result in unsuccessful cooperation
fourthly in my course group work is an essential part
absolutely all of our lecturers have good presentation skills have good ppt slides i can easily get the pointthey have good body language and eye contact i feel they try to engage me and expect me to answer or ask questions
during my undergraduate studies i only need to pay attention to my own study
everyone has their own advantages and disadvantages teamwork is a complementary role
students needto step out of their roles if they want to improve
before the presentation i did not understand it whywe did our homework well and innovative
but if we put the small stones and sand in first we cant put the big stones
now i can raise my own questions during the classbesides in the traditional chinese teaching style all the knowledge taught by teachers and our students just need to follow them and seldom do we have the interaction part
however i am not sure if i can understand them when it has been a long time
everyone can stick to their opinions and work
after the further research i would combine the new note with the previous one to make me be able to understand it
the second reason is whether i can adapt to the many ways of course tasks such as our entrepreneurial course tasks
as for the situation where i display nonproductive behaviours bad habits andor poor choicesi want to take time management as a examplei ever had poor time management beforei made a timetable by myself and i managed my time in detailin the beginningi felt very confident in finishing the timetablehowever just after several daysi failed to finish my timetable finallyi think the reason why i could not finish the timetable was that my timetable was arranged tightlyin the beginningi strove to finish the timetablethen i started to be lazy and i gave up the timetable eventuallyfrom the situationi realized that i should arrange my time more flexible and i need to improve my efficiencywhat i can do is to give priority to the most important thing when i make my timetablei think i must avoid this situation in the futureafter all i think it is vital for me to have good time management during this yearpoor time management will influence the quality of finishing academic work and efficiency of studying during the whole year
i can learn both technical knowledge and management knowledge from it
i will make the decision more deeply4
therefore in the future i need to correct this problem and be brave enough to point out the wrong things
in my first degree teacher taught the whole and complete process and answer
i have already done on the previous link
only in this way can make task completed
the final result was that i did not pass the exam
in addition we have a good cooperation with each other and everyone can express own opinion
i dont have much group works this term
when individuals involved could capitalise on one anothers resources and skills asking one another for information evaluating one anothers ideas monitoring one anothers work etc
if i say something to that person they just ignore that
we worked as a team and knew the strength of a team is greater than that of the individualbecause everyone said what he thinks
besides some basic tools function will be showed and some skills such as presentation and references have been showed
when students ask questions in the class or after the teacher has finished speaking the teacher can quickly respond accordinglythe teachers ppt content is concise clear and well organized and it is easy for students to see the key points
treating academics is something that can not be sloppy
it is a very meaningful thing to be able to reach different cultures in different countries
i generally take notes of lectures delivered in classes
in china there is little time for performances or demonstrations in class10
im glad that i had the opportunity to contribute in it
civil engineering do not need read many books but now i need to read more books6
the specification of the lecture is well
i have seen people who have no ideas but cant listen to others opinions
the lectures are really well structured and they are lined up in a logical order so we have a continuous flow of knowledge and learning
as for the ranking of the importance of notes i constructed my notes this waycourse title timeheading 1secondary title 12level 3 headings 123 use level 3 headings at mostcontent essential points will be highlighted in red questions like this
job application
of course
confidence motivation open mind be proactive ambition
i believe that at this moment i can manage very well all myassignatures and workload
i hope that in the future my english will be better and better i can quickly understand the meaning of the teacher and i can further interact with the teacher and quickly master the professional knowledge
how to present your content in a proper and interesting way is also important
the knowledge of engineering management may change with the life but physics will not4there are more activities of engineering management study like doing questionnaire making business plan5
first i think its important to properly extend the short items on power point
i major in accounting during the period of the undergraduate but i dont want to major in accounting for my master so i change my major
we are all very excited and happy and we are striving to realize our dreams
that makes me confused
but i have an advice that i hope in law of engineering management teacher could tell us the content of next class in advance so that student could preview because i think law is a little difficult and there are many glossary in course
creating a harmonious team by taking advantage of individuals behavior can greatly improve the team and individual performancethere is no perfect individual but there is a perfect teameveryone has a role in the team that suits them best
i think the main difference is that everyone has a different background
each lecturers speech style is different but the same is that they all want their lecture to be instructive
that reduces the difficulty for students to understand
below are some of the main differences between my first degree and the em masters degree in york
there is a specific booklet which makes a clear and fair standard for us to follow
the city itself is also smallerin addition i do not currently have a weekly meeting with a supervisor or tutor which was a fixture through all of the years of my undergraduate study
after i found these can interrupt my studying i want to change
every teacher uses slides in class so i can grasp what the teacher said through the slides
i think the session is helpful in my study
i strongly believe that in order to materialize an idea you need to communicate it appropriately whether this is in words a diagram code or any other form
so now i have much more time to spend in my studies than then
i think this is a very efficient learning behavior in class so i think such students will succeedhowever there are also some behavior s that do not pay attention to lectures such as sleeping in class daydreaming chatting with peers or playing games
i think this may be my weakness
when i read the academic book i need critical thinking but in china i just need to took notes9
i didn  t make many interactions with the lecturer and am not positive with the questions asked by the lecturer
his lecture is always full of humour and he does not simply read the slides
in order to let us know what they speakour tutor may use microphone or speak loudly
and i believe if i fixed theproblem it would help me a lot
i always think that the reserved time is sufficient but in fact it is not enough
there are very few individuals or group presentations in the chinese education system
i find it a lot more preferable to take notes afterwards when reviewing a lecture during self studying but once again the notes that i am most likely to do are the ones found on the side of my code as the best way for me to learn is through experimentation
without anyone the group is not integrated
besides their slides always clear and design to help us understand well
and even when i acknowledgeprocrastination i need to perform actions against it to fight effectively
bad moods paralyzed my team and i failed to contain itbefore it caused severe damage
yes， i do
i think the other students in my group are great martin is like a brother lead us to finish our work qi always think in a different way to sell smart pillows was her idea and lin is a hard worker and give us her opinions in discussion daisy and harry also are important parts in our group we always have different views about something which is very great for a groupwe can help each other when we study as a group i am like a coordinator in this group and they help me to think big to think in a different wayi think the main factor is teamwork it is very important for a group
after class our teacher will assign some meaningful tasks to exercise our relevant skills which i think is also an indispensable part of learning
i learned that the thinking patterns are different between different cultures respect is always important
induction programme was a great opportunity to get known places tutors the most important informations about the course and people from my course
for example on weekends when i want to review what ive learned this week i cant organize what i need to do on saturdays or sundays to learn
i expected as i saw most people are good at listening to others and waiting for their turn to speak
therefore after i know that we have a lot of group work and presentation this year on the one hand i am happy that i have so many opportunities to get exercise
1 clear learning tasks
besides this sometimes teacher will give us some questions we should answer in our presentation or some perspectives to help us to thinking and summarizing our views
to be honest bidyut ‘ speaking speed is suitful to me so i can follow the lecture
so i feel little confused
not blame any of the team members
here i will learn to arrange my own time4undergraduate study pays more attention to theoretical knowledge and current learning focuses on practice5here i can have more time to disposal6here my independent living ability has been improved7there is a lot of emphasis on cooperation here and there are not many requirements in my undergraduate study8studying here i entered different language environments which is very helpful for my english level which is obviously different from the undergraduate9i will now focus more on the balance between learning and life
firstly it is my honor to be an international students at university of york
but now we have to prepare the presentation do some case study and exam in the last semester8
there are many reasons for the failure of group cooperative learning
finallyi hope to get a satisfactory result
as for bidyut he has a good habit in produce the slides he always highlights the key points in different colors
notes are a memory tool to help us review
more importantly in the process of group learning only everyone can complete their assigned tasks in order to complete the work of the entire group
if we encounter some challenges i hope that we can communicate more and understand each other and do more preparations for the difficulties we have encountered
for instance in the last homework in strategic managementmy group was not selected
first i found that working with different peoplecan come up with so many different good ideas especially when the groupmembers are from different countries
in this term we have some courses which need lots of group working
affirm the quality of the teachers teaching
so there are many presentations for me is a big challenge
for example if someone just wang to pass the assignment but the rest of us want to achieve distinction so we dont have the common goals
at the same time this can enhance the academic exchange atmosphere and improve the quality of teaching
after the lecture there is always the possibility to speak with lecturer personally and solve something that is nonunderstandable
body language5
through the mutual communication with team members the information obtained in the classroom is integrated and processed together
allocate the work to group members
different cultural backgrounds5
however anything that could be important to the completion of a given coursework assignment is compiled in a word document dedicated to that particular coursework assignment for ease of review at a later date
for example there are many simple mistakes that can not be found in a short time but it is easy to find them if you look at them later
constantly being focused in the lecture is something that i find hard to do but on the other side taking notes it in a way
be active and serious about the work of the group and complete the required tasks on time2
i think this is a good way to foster success
the number of peoplein the group is controlled within five people
i have a little concern about my study but i will try my best
but in britain relatively speaking teachers only talk about the most important and basic theories and we need to find a lot of extended materials for the homework3
that is the reason why i decided to return to school and pursue a graduate degree
when we work together on a project integrating different insights into a viable solution will be a huge success
they can always give me some conclusive advice
these things sometimes play against collaborative learning whenthe group is formed with different cultures inside collaborative learning
after college entrance examination to avoid the girl who refuse my love i made a extremely foolish decision i chose a university which was not that good because i did not want to meet that girl
i think the students in my class are not like to connect with teacher when a teacher wants to have some communication with us few of us talkwhen we in a group discussion all my classmates were brillianttheir thoughts are insightful unique but when we need to do some presentations or some public speeches our thinking becomes dullsoi hope we can feel confident when we need to show us and have more communication with teachers
this week the main task of course personal effectiveness and masterclasses is about the presentation skills and i think our teachers are the best model for us
instructors generally arrange qampa sessions at the end of the class or after the course content ends
it is normal that girls are more shy than boys so as our groupi think it is really a challenge to negotiate with the whole group and promote the progress of any projects and i will try my best to finish teamwork
here are some detailsi am always used to putting my assignments and tasks to submit in the last day even though i have done it before
for our team we all from china we have the same perspective of one task which is the homework or something we dont have the iceberg we avoid the risk of hidden culture so the point of our team in a different opinion that is the regional culture different
ive noticed that some of my classmates would take some notes before the class it is quite helpful to absorb more knowledge in the class another is that some dare to debate with doctors when they hold different opinions and tutors encourage these conflict thinkings
but there are some difficult about taking notes
in addition the confidence of some chinese students in speaking english is very good i hope i can do the same
i also have a lot of bad habitsnonproductive behaviors
before coming to york i have a blurry definition and conception about the engineering management course
most of us do not have base of knowledge in law
and be a nativespeaker
my supervision group mates are very friendly i think we could be a effective team
the two points that afternoon sessions can best help me are to let me know the syllabus of msc engineering management in advance and learn the learning experience of several predecessors
during or after class if i have some confusion about the content and ask the lecturers they always reply to me patiently and patiently
finally i dont know whether there will be some accidences including illness and accidence in the future
actually the language is one of the most different thing with previous study
without cooperation which takes and energy and is difficult to succeed in the end
personal teamwork plays a key role in the progress of a team
im quite enjoying the kind of atmosphere
if i do everything bythese principles i will become prominent on my studying and working life howeverin the future i need to improve myself by learning something like how to dealwith risks how to act with care all the time how to give others correct guidanceand so on
keep studying and keep asking questions2
currently when i need to make a decision i always try to calm down and think is that what i really want to do
i will do reflection every week before i rarely did it7when im in classi should take note instead of just listeningbecause the lecturers in english it is very hard for to remember the knowledge by just listening8english teaching and learning is different from before9
it is difficult to take notes in very shorttime
i think all lecturers of our course define what they want to tell us clearly
during this timei have faced and overcome some challenges presented by this new stage
compared with the previous studythere are many different contents in the homework
but i admit that i am not enough careful sometimes and lazy to do the deeper research which would affect the work
collaborative learning is still learning the only difference is student work as a team so they could shorten the time of studying to achieve the same goal as before
it is helpful to preview the lecture power point and references given by the professors in advance
its important for me when giving a talk because its the core of the presentation and will to a largr extnet influence the quality of it
however all these things can not be the barriers that i want to be a distinction grade student
it is different with my graduate school
the communication between the members of the same group is very important which will make everyone understand each other
and the lecturer engaged with our eyetoeye very much
as a postgraduate student we should concentrate to our learning time in university especially while lecturers giving presentation in class
i learned engineering management in both university
when lecturer answer our questions they are patient and full of passion they can explain their thoughts and then answer the questions whether the question is sample or complex
when i came back to china in addition to fulfilling the companys goals and gaining profits i felt that respect for life law the environment and public good respect and protect personal information and intellectual property
as an extroverted person i am very easy to go along with that i have many friends
in china the lecturers are more pay attention to delivery the knowledge
to be honest i have a little concerns about this programme
this is what i learned from joanna
i expected more introductions for each course from teacher which can help to preview in advance
leader should keep the work process and make sure it is on the right direction
if they insist on their own opinion the team needs to discuss to choose a better solution otherwise the efficiency of the team will be reduced
thirdteam members need to have strong learning ability
furthermore the next lectures aren  t much more advanced from that before so it is easy to follow the main core of the lecture
when team members failed to finish the work as a leader as the rest members all of them should encourage him and help him to put forward
with the international students in question i can offer an opportunity to help them with said language barrier and give them experience in working with someone from a different culture
the lecturers often engage with us eyetoeye
miracles are the inevitable result of our everyday effortsso runme and fight for your dreams
in this way i can use the methods or models well in my reports8
besides this list can help me to manage my time as well i will use this to do list contrast with my google calendar and making sure for things goes smoothly
my previous major was on the east campus of york university campus where the overall number of people was relatively small and only three colleges were located in the east campus
it is the wonderful experience i think
friends can bring me happiness and laughter
then i think the main reason i took notes is becauseit maintains me active in the class
and when a group discussion is needed they will come up to us and ask for our conclusions and give some advice
sometimes they will also talk about some related knowledge
what i say is what i have made progress
after each lecture the lecturer will answer the questions raised by the students
compared with the concerns i look forward to the unknown challenges more especially learning my undergraduate knowledge and let me understand indepth technologies and management methods related to engineering management by my original knowledge level
as it was only the first week i did not observe the shortcomings ofthe team members
yes because i have completed a oneyear premasters course in the uk so i have a certain understanding of the graduate course so the model and components of the course are basically the same as my expectations
until ten oclock i felt a little sleepy wash and go to bed
i like the program
when purchasing raw materials instead of following the normal screening bidding proceduresi gave the order to a company which have bribed me
i think the only problem in our team is that we have not yet found an effective mode of cooperation
different sense of time
sometiomes it is very hard to make a decision whether i should shoose the profit nor the public benefit even though everything is under the law
third because of this
there is no doubt that i want to get the distinction grade thus i always work hard with my groupmates
that is the reason why i think the most important thingfor the master students is to find the things that people really want to do
i believe i can do better in the future
it would be better off to everyone if they share questions and answers with others because others may also have same questions in their minds
on the basis of understanding and trust if we want to cooperate more efficiently and quickly we also need to understand others and carry out appropriate team building such as eating dinners and team activities
not only in terms of the grades but also means that i hope to improve myself in many aspects for example enhancing my leadership ability time management ability independent learning ability and english writing and speaking abilities and so on
respect other when they are taking3
but i have two suggestions for this
environmental design has not been exposed toeconomic theory but em has connection with economics
first i need to practice more writing because i would liketo write at high level and present good reports
secondly lectures adjust and change their contents due to different results after last class
in order to have a great knowledge of the law for the management i have read some books and scan some websites about laws in britain
therefore i need to arrange my time more carefully to deal with different subjects
i believe that em will be very helpful to my future employment
my job was elaboration and inviting different contractors in order tochoose the best postor
i found that some students are very active to answer the questions this is what i lack of
therefore the group work reinvigorated my creative thinkingthe second one is team work
there are only a little group experience in my formal education
in the last degree we often go to class in the evening from about seven to ten in the evening
and also the personality of different team members determines the progress of the team project
lecturers voice is clear and loud
environmental designfocuses on practice while em focuses on the combination of practice andtheory
then sometimes i am careless
msc in em at york only one exam for students
so from this part of the lecture i want to say they are all expert and excellent
it definitely feels like it will be more focused and challenging which does fall in line with my expectations nicely
international business the tutor of international business is really kind and he always wishes to answer our questions
teamwork is sometimes not flexible as single one4
i think they need to work hard one of them is my premaster classmate he almost failed to pass the foundation course
i really like the group work and like the interesting activities in the class
some chinese students are good at communication and they can easily make a friend with others even the first they meet
to tell you the truth everyone is different andeveryone has his her own personality
i don  t know what otherpeople thinks but in my opinion i do believe the subject is quite ambiguous instrategy management class
after class they went to the library to make some further research to enhance their knowledge and make deeper investigation
1 be united2
nor did anything surprise me in particular
sharing what we have learned and learning from others is the most effective method because we will simplify what we know and make it easier to understand in the process of expression
this requires us to explain to them when we are working on the same team
i only remember some important content and something i want to ask the teacher after class because all the slides and materials have a digital version
for example one of my groupmate is a shaper she may generate action and thrive on pressure and increase our efficiency of a project
the term is shorter than my first degree
i am so surprised that we had teamwork we had some pictures and we talked about a production
i believe i can be the person that i want to be a day in the future as i never stop my steps forever
in china we usually use usb flash disk to download the slides from the lectures
communication is important
secondly we coulduse you couldinstead of you mustwhen we givesuggestions to others
yes i acquired lots of information about our department of electronic engineering such as msc programmes staffs and student supports
first our generation has their own ideas and hopes that others can act according to their own ideas so that there will be differences inevitably
his words brought me shock and made me reexamine my recent actions
after this experience i felt that my reaction at the time wasfunny
the major of study is different
i think the teachers are very good at all the lectures
the first one is that almost everyone goes to the courses on time and try their best to finish the assignment
of course sometimes a selfcentered leader will also cause group work to fail
our thought sometimes gets different we need more talking
in my supervision group consist of different nationalities for me how to speak and work with them is a big challenge but i have faith in myself
i can not say it is bad due to fewer work it depends someone like someone dislike
if you have time read more booksthe fourth quadrant is not urgent and not important
and i feel happy about the induction programme we are divided into different groups so that we can meet some new friends
i see there are some lectures about economic in the content of the international business module i know a little about this aspect before so i think it will be a challenge to me during the group work
i have been working hard to trust others and share the responsibility of the project
i do understand different people have different target but we should work hard to achieve group goal and target since we work as a group
and what impressed me mostly is the group of germany a chinese man act a german boss who was annoyed by his collegues and subordinates and he acted vividly and all of us bursted into a laughteri think it is important for me to learn cultural diversity and keep an openmind to accept it
i want to change myself to become more active in class like western students
my computer broke down
at the end of the semester the situation of report will be the end while at china the exam will be the end
think more achieve more
normally i can get a good grade in academic work
a main difference is i need to use a foreign language other than my mother language
in nost countries sending a bribe to others means break the law
i knew this thought is very ridiculousso i will change my thought and try to speak out my opinion even if my opinionhas shortage
2 master program requires me to do all kinds of research independently no standard answer is given
also i didnt want to review my notes for the reason that it didnt make any sense
so i need to focus on avoiding plagiarism
i always believe that the environment can change a person and learning is the same
actually in china i havent had experience in teaching style like this way it is really different for me to experience
so i need to learn how to work with my group partners and keep the good concinnous relationship between us
personally i think the lecturers would give audiences student a first impression about what they want to talk about like put the key words in the ppt or give some examples to make an introduction
besides it seems that we will got opportunities to simulate working in a corporation which might be very useful for our career
this year i prefer to spend more time with my friends or group members
some of them learned construction before that is good because i learned construction area as well which means in the future we will have some common points to make conversation and talk
so i think there are two ways to solve the problem
for teaching styles there are more interactions between students and lecturer
i will get a different mindset in the future
even if an individual does not present his or her role test heor she will be cashed out in team activities
the final thing is selfcontrol
i didt encounter such a situation before
certain lectures also really arent suited to lecturing
asjoanna said everyones time is limited
may be it is better for audience to show a table at beginning which can tell them what the presentation is about and what will be coveredand smile because it can make the audience feel more welcomethe lecturer did it very well
1listening to other members carefully is important2when receiving other members advice that you disagree you should think about it carefully before refuting3allocating the assignments according to the things that the members are good at4using others advantage to cover your shortage and vice versa5being punctual being responsible for your own task being active in discussion6having the courage of your opinions
that behaviors of contractorswere contrary to the rae ethical principles
one of my classmates invited us to have dinner in order to be elected president of the student union
and i also want to be a good student but my procrastination has always been blocking me
from then on iwould make a timetable to tell myself what time to do
i am excited for the programme
1 study independently2
secondly each of us has a different undergraduate degree so there may be multiple solutions when encountering problems
i took my laptop and my computer with me in class
we should comply with the group rules such as arriving atmeetings on time and no delay for one  s own tasks
good patience good communication skills good at discovering the strengths of others and humbly accepting good opinions and solutions from different teammates or others good leaders good sense of cooperation enthusiasm for work or doing things
i received the invitation and had a happy night which would cause a sleepin on a saturday
it also helps us understand
for example if the teacher left homework in class i would discuss it with my group after class
the higher the importance the brighter thecolour
a chinese boy in my classa i dont know his name now has a very splendid english tongue who is admired by me
the activities that were conducted during the induction programme helped me to know and understand my coursemates
another way to rectify this issue would be to organize revisionwork to be on campus and away from our homes so there is less chance of feeling too comfortable at home and being distracted
if you are perfunctory how can you succeed
well after a semester of group study i think unity is very important
i brainstorm some of the problems i have like procrastination time management challenges and stress management challengesthe situation where i display nonproductive behaviors bad habits and poor choices i am going to describe is following contentin fact it happened last 3 weekends
firstly i was not suitable for this teaching and education style but after 2 months experience i found i am get used to this specific style for further learning
i am not an expert but i give my humble opinion ithink that there are three factorsfirst cultural differences is a factor that playsagainst collaborative learning
emphasizing the key points
at the university of york they are only responsible forhelping to find the mistakedifference list learning styleeducational style teamwork cultural differences evaluation criteria
use technical equipments to study more frequently laptop ipad 3 know more about how to manage time4
this will better grasp the focus on the review and better understand what i learned from the class
although there may be no clear leader or group leader for each group to carry out activities in the later discussion the group will gradually accept that it is more obedient to the arrangement of one person who can make the work go on better
all of lectures flow logically and i can know deeply
in the final exam we often recite some useful knowledge for the test
more communication can help resolve most of the conflicts and all the members can reach an agreement
this may also be the ill attitude of learning for many years
yes i think this is an obligation for me to work as an engineering manager
inbusiness is important to have promotional video
i know it is quite difficult but i still work hard towards requirements and standards on the assignment
academic work as highly pleasurablethe hourly rate of the lectures and workshops is selected optimally – no too much no too less
i can learn a lot of things from the lecturer
if there are some challenges in my group work in the future the first thing i should do is understanding cultural differences and recognizing themand then the members of groups should have more communications with each otherin addition its important for team members to learn the culture coming from others countries and take more transpositional consideration
apply the knowledge acquired in the management classes for the team
it is a good habit no matter in study or work in the future
sometimes the speed of lecturers is too quickly to catch up with
every time everyone lectures they will often gather together to discuss the operation of the enterprise and some classroom activities arranged in the classroom
i hope that i can overcome this bad habit in this term and not be late anymore
different language
although group cooperative learning is an essential and useful way of learning it is not a panacea it should also be organically combined with other learning methods especially with the organic combination of independent learning in order to play a better cooperative effect
i am writing my repots these days and i usually come across problems that i could not resolved so i would ask related tutors
i wish i want to talk to english people very skifully as same as him
from very beginning we should decide which product we are going to produce and we should do the marketing part for promoting our products
when i was in china i always was the leader in a group however i find so many weakness that i need to improved now i need to transform my role in the group
i will more active when we have collaborative learning
with my previous experiences i will always follow to the rules and regulations during my msc and even through my life as an engineerthere maybe challenges when we are working in a team with people from various backgrounds but i believe that i can manage and handle situations since i have prior experiences of leading and working in a team during my undergraduate programme and in my workplace
when i give a speech the personal posture is simple and clean the body language cant be rigid the audience should be visualized the speech speed should be appropriate the language should be clear and clear so that every viewer can clearly know what you want to express
and i think the group assignment is a very good way to success
they will usually answer each question patiently and be more detailed
the good part is i am completely overwhelmed bytheir energy and passion and this is exactly what i was hoping to see
because in my past class at university the style of class is normal without discussion
by cooperation we can solve the problems in group working
i can use body language and humor to liven up the atmosphere of the scene when giving a speech
everyone basically uses computers to do this kind of thing
the first thing i learned was confidence
however at that time we wasted a lot of time on some meaningless things such as the departmental responsibility of the company we were working on a business plan the departmental responsibility is not the most important content in the company structure
put forward my own opinion and listen to others advise
i always focus on them
i realize my own shortcomings
as for the studying i must to say the aim i come to the university from uk is change the attitude about studying and working
there are more interactions required in msc courses than before
using strategy approaches ahead of time and developing practical plans i do believe that i can properly handle these issues and eventually become distinction grade studen
2i need to improve my critical thinking than before
and then he assigned our group a nationalcultural type of the lewis model we were asked to play role in a team who was responsible for managing the situation that there was a serious nuclear radiation leak
each teacher has his own different teaching methods
i think i can be responsible for helping the team to communicate with each other checking that the formatting requirements of our writing are correct as well as assigning each part of the work that everyone is responsible for and helping the team to finalize the task
the whole lecture seems fluently and there is a strong connection between each point
but i think my teammates in the group four are very awesome
certainly yes
marketing of technologyexplore technical marketing aimed at developing a complete marketing plan
definitely the west university teaching style is totally different from asian education style
some people are suitable to play the role of leader and creator while others like to play the role of coordinator and executorwe can quickly and accurately find our position in the team through selfanalysis tools and other peoples evaluation of us
besides both of them can also help me relieve anxiety
but the similarities is also important because we should reach a consensus in some problem
ingroup collaboration what i learned is that we must have some compromises and ourown insistence and position
to do list makes it visually clear for me to keep the things i need to do in my mind
students who do not study seriously are generally not welcomed by classmates
at the beginning of the task i often feel that the time is a lot of dragging and dragging time and there will be little left which will affect the quality of the task completion
although it can guarantee that i finish the task i lost much time and sometimes have a relatively bad mental state in class of next day
lack of sleep led to a decrease in learning efficiency the nextday so more study time was needed
the population density of it is 5963 per square mile while inyork the data is only 27 per square mile
moreover ineed to write reports which is part of my assessment
what surprises me is that my supervisorgroup team members are very motivated
i will come up with new ideas
it was really good and fun working in the groups because i always believe in team works which would yield more results when compared to a person doing the same work alone
and i think that this situations are often presentin every team i dont expect that everyone has all the knowledge
boshu jin a male classmate of mine who always reads tons of recommended books has a huge reserve of knowledge which could help him keep pace with the teacher easier
its still too early to tell
during my college i had a presentation to do
in the international business teachers start with cultural differences let us pay attention to cultural differences in international exchanges and then involve the process of capitalism and globalization
i can communicate with them in advance and generally understand the direction of the future thesis
some of my team member turns out to belacking of motivation so sometimes i need to push them and motivate them
a final summary of the lectures learning objectives is given at the end which has been helpful as it has established the key takeaways for each lecture
during the lecture of management of technology i have seen slides of noel jackson has deep research because i did electrical and electronics engineering and on one subject when you add diversity of things that make it really amazing so thats why i love to tale that lecture remaining subjects are new for me but i have learnt so many new things related to business even though i have studied entrepreneurship in mu undergraduate degree but that was not quite obvious now i get the idea how basically entrepreneur can work how we can create ideas thats amazing
both the learning pressure and the homesick faced with me i believe i can handle this personal trouble through the ‘ resilience  5
secondly we should listen to others opinions and opinions more attentively
2 here are many group learning tasks which will improve the ability to cooperate
the most impressing session is the course when we were cooperating to build a paper towel to hold an orange
each member should know what their strengths and weaknesses are and use them to the teams advantage
moreover i am going to respect the lawswhere the project is executed before to start it
words always have different meaningin the different sentencethirdly i use the dictionary and do notuse google translate
therefore we can help each other in different area to solve the problem better
fully understand the importance of english and it shows that good communication skills are the foundation of everything 7
in york we have all content about our lectures on vle2
as a result i should practice my speaking skills
no concerns so far im pleasantly surprised so far
the lectures for management amp marketing of technology gives a clear scope and specification on the topics each lecture discusses
i think the other students in the supervision team are very smart they are very fluent in spoken english there is no obstacle to communication and their attitude is very sincere
strategy management north is a kind tutor who always put the smile on her face
for example for embedded engineering projects the choice of sensors is often determined by the functional requirements but the functional requirements are determined by the customer so a complete embedded project is a business layer that includes both the technical layer and the market research layer
in china our students are good at listening what teacher taught but we are encouraged to speak out our thought
when our team is challenged i think the most important thing is that everyone can speak their mind and play a role in the team such as leading organizing and making decisionsi think in the international business module let me know the different culture is quite different have a plenty of small details can make a big mistake so in the team work the first thing to know every group members background culture through the communication is to understand each other learn each others culture and customs etc in the work respect each other so as to avoid misunderstanding in the workplace
although i have never learned reluctant course i still heard some cases about law from my mother
i can easily follow the lecturers and write down key points when i use this method so i accustom to mind mapping at present
i  m more fluent and confident in speaking writing starts to be much easier listening is much better but i have still problems sometimes with understanding
i found that my classmates very quiet and shyfew of us to answer questionsso i expect we can more proactive
here in york is very clear theresearch tendency and how it is promoted to the students2 due dates for my previous assessments even when we hada due date for the delivers teachers were more flexible about the marks
at this time there may be some trouble things happened and lead to a failed collaboration
second the lack of interaction in chinese domestic classes has led some students to only passively listen
but i think some examples added by the teacher are very useful they can help me better understand the content of the lecture
in consequence of course the lecturers know what are they going to talk about and also most of the lecturers i think that all of them include an introduction slide at the beginning of the class explaining what will they talk about
the consequence of laziness is that the task at that time can not be completed on time and the task at the next section can not be completed which affects the completion of the next section
i think those aspects are worthy to be learned
chatting with students sitting aroud ourselves about topics irrelevant to the lecture will hinder success
let me know the schools architectural layout
it can be said that electronic design is my favourite thing on the planet
third engineering management focus more on people management
leadership is not clearin the group work there is no clear leadership which leads to unclear objectives insufficient direct path to implement tasks confused methods and no unified system which makes the task completed slowly and of low quality
when the enterprise interests are contradicted with public welfare and others factors its challenging for engineers to adhere to principle especially when their company occurs some financial problems its hard to say whether they will strictly follow the rules and respect for life the environment as well as public good
as for me i think that i have already been in the honesty and integrity and i can respect for life law the environment and public good
because the success of the team is not the effort of one person but the efforts of the team members
if everyone does not have acommon target they will not get the achievement
the allocation should encourage team members to explain the concept thoroughly to each other
like my team they always have unique opinions on some issuesin my opinion these problems are toohierarchical such as this problem which i have expressed abovethis week is both a welcome week and apersonal reflection week reflecting on how we learned valuable knowledge andrecognizing that teachers who selflessly share knowledge while unable toprotect us in so many ways are amazing when it comes to learningit is an interesting course just for the personalmaster improvement class
i am certainly convenient that it is really critical in a group
i am satisfied with the lectures so far
during the study in york i feel that the time management is really for me
these sources can be easily understoodfinallythe course contents have many different forms
in this way time is saved naturally and our work will be more efficient
review and preview the course we learnedhinder success1
however the biggest element that prevents me from getting the distinction will be the cultural obstacle
one persons power is limited however anassigning one thing to multiple people may make the result more perfect
whether i can make a good presentation depends on whether i can master what i need to tell
this makes me to understand my notes better afterwords
but once again there are some surprises but moresurprises and 70 selfmotivation
as follows there are some factors that can result in a successful collaborative learningfirst trust and respect are vital in the collaborative learning
they are good at finding resource and originazing but their capacity of speaking is a little bit poor so do i
although there are also some papers there is only a defence link after graduation
i am also a person who likes sports
in my own opinion i have a lot of bad habits laziness
motivate me to be prepared to study in advance also the internships and work that i may face in the futurei think the course introduction is very useful
that is a efficient group activity because we can get familar with each otherin the futurei can avoid some problems with them owing the fact of knowing their characteristici think time management is important for collaborative learning
i am investing a lot of time reading at least two books ineach course to understand the basic concepts better
at the same time there aremany positive factors in successful collaborative learningfirst of all respect each other
in the end i will modify our assignment with mypartner
they can provide some useful advice when i come through difficulties and answer my questions
i think that the teacher is guiding and more important is to think more about myself
yes i believe this programme can give me what i want
i can use various learning methods to improve my learning level have my own learning process and learning results to reflect on my habits i can use the knowledge of different subjects i have learned
i think i can follow the ethical principles of engineers and restrain myself
our energy is limited and our energetic time period is different
i can improve my own deficiencies by observingothers and why do i deliberately tell others that i have changed
when it come to my dorm there are no othershere and i can do whatever i what and won  t be disturbed by others
usuallypeople from different countryeven different districthave different culture backgroundso i can see that here must be some challenges in our future group work such as misunderstanding and accentbut i think we can overcome all of these problems by good communiactionrespecting everybodays culture and sharing our ideas sincerelyand on the other hand the students like us from all over the world can really learn too much from each other and make an achievement if we can work together well
first from the timetable i knew what subjects i need to learnthe general direction of em has been understood
i used to have some talks before some audience but i was so nervous to talk loudly my voice is also seems a little shake that time
and this class can help me in pick up the skill of cooperation
nothats i expected
as i expected we met with our project leaders and had a simple conversation
as an international student i have a few concerns about next year at the university mainly because language reasons
i really feel the differences between thistwo countries there is a saying in our country beautiful mountain，beautiful water but so boring its because that chinese thinkthose foreign countries especially european countries and canada etc are ofperfect natural scenery but less people and poor entertainments
for example the work of programming could not be completely discussed because it is a work of individual thinking and the logical structure of programming should be discussed rather than the concrete implementationfrom another perspective some jobs do not require collaborative learning which is a learning method that expands and deepens views
for example one girl in my group is a little trouble maker who always delay assignment submission and bother me for a long time for helpeven about very easy cases when im busyfor my businesses
there are some chinese students whose english is very fluent
i have spent a lotof time to get out of games by doing other interesting things
in the process of taking notes it is impossible to record all the contents taught by the lecturer
it is in harmony with what he is saying
i think i can increase the amount of content that needs to be recorded
although sometimesmaybe most of time i still dont know what they are saying when they speak quickly i think i make a great progress on my english listening and skills for lectures
i think i will try my best to do my best
therefore we can learn more from the different case
faith and courage
this requires me to learn knowledge in a short time
so i decided get up earlier than before and reduce the time of entertainment
some times hanging out with friends could also hinder me from not giving attention and time to selfstudy
i won  t consider myself as anoutgoing person so it would take steps to build my leadership
so i gave up the orchestra that joined the school
when we study together someone has his own questions others can help him find the answer
i think this is very general thing
yes，i canbribery from all sideslack of ability to make wrong judgmentsunfair competition（jealousy for peers）can not accurately identify and recognize risksdeceiving customers to gain more benefitsonly focus on projects and ignore environmental protectionfalsely report your true ability to achieve your goalsin order to shorten the construction period and increase the working time of workerswaste of materials
i often indicate possible test questions by put a wavy line under the note
the next hour is the learning time
this is normal
the opinion may be unexpectedly good
in the dailylife i have a bad habit is i would like to study or do thing at the whole pointsuch as 1900 or 1630 if i miss it i must wait for another whole point tostart my work
i sort through my reading on the internet so i wrote a blog about how to beat my biggest weakness
if people can not trust and tolerate each other a lot of conflict will appear
yes its cool right now i have a problem of a little bit english language and i am really hopeful i will learn soon and teachers are really supportive
i think that students by their parents to give hope or have theirown dream to realise we should strictly control their own behaviour in apositive enthusiastic attitude to face the academic work
that  s where things go wrongwhen we finished the design phase mymanager wants to take a break so he decided to put me in charge
forexample when the weather forecast shows sunny day and there are dark clouds inthe sky i may not bring umbrella and may be splashed wet
in the beginning i always want to take every word teachers said
on the other side apartfrom the study in school some others have their own activities outside schoolthis is another problem for group tasks
so we are strict with ourselves to obey the rules in our society to make the daily life and society system keep the normal operation
so i think we should work hard to overcome it
and the essay has its format requirement how to write a clear essay is very important
the rae ethical make up principles that a engineer should be honesty and integrity respect for life law the environment and public good be accuracy and rigour have leadership and communication
sometimes the audiences would feel bored with thecontent and the saying some jokes related to the contents can attract the audiences  attention back to the presentationsecond
i dont know if it is because of the different cultures or maybe because getting here in the university and also in the city was not a big problem for them but i feel that a lot of the students especially international students arent committed with the studies
to avoid this situation when i noticed that i am thinking about other thing out of the class i will try to pinch myself and get my attention back to class
i believe that this year will be busy but substantial
moreover its not just the speech itself it is also an opportunity to impart new interesting and creative ideas which is also a kind of a respect for the audience
i just think we can have some enterprise lecture will help us better to know the application of our job opportunities
in addition everyone should fulfill their duties and responsibilities
i think all of the lecture are very nice maybe because im in the front position i can hear all the lecterer clearly
they used slide clearly and speak loudly and clearly
i feel that time past veryfast
the good reputation can be gained since the company always follow the principles and more company would like to make a deal with the good reputation company which means more profit
i just had a lot of conversation with many classmates
i think we should concentrate on how to solve the problem rather than battle with emotion which lead to unsuccessful group work
i will elaborate on my owndevelopment in terms of learning style and educational styleon the one hand the learning style isunique and individual
sometimes their ideas are not so good or they are repeated with otherideas but this kind of communication make our team closer to the success2
at present china needs to improve its software urgently
it may be that they have lost interest in reading books for now5
in the term of the difference between my bachelor degree and the msc in em here at york there are so many variations for me to say1
yes i am
in every lecture the slide is clear that help us to follow the teachers rhythm very well
we could choose one interested area as the research direction
to be honest the induction session really solved my problem in life and lighten my worries about my study
as we all knownlibrary is a good place to search the literatures or pay attention to study
lastly trying to accept others thoughts and opionions is very essential
fourth it is very simple
personal roles
2 in china，the exam is the way to check if you are serious about class
international business goodmanagement and marketing of technology greatlaw for engineering management excellentmsc personal effectiveness and masterclasses nicestrategy management for em lovely
i need to organize it after lecture although i could understand what i make the notes even in a long time
yes i have a suggestion can our each lesson record their lesson videos
you dont want to have to keep trying to figure out how and where you recorded certain information
and i would like to help others at any time
how can you finish your learning cyclewhen you missed an important part of it
when you stand on the platform all the audience will focus on you it is difficult to completely avoid the nervous and remain the rich content and logic of what you want to express i think it may need rich experiences
i think it is a good idea that to be prepared before going to class
some groupmates like to do every work as soon as they can which can help others and the whole group improve the efficiency of study
for living the biggest difference is the language and culture
in our group everyone has their good ideas and they have strong personal skills
lastly it is hard for to make a choice so i think should learn to how to make a choice wisely and how to give up
actually i am happy with this experience so far
yes i think collaborative learning is a quite important not only in modules
i think leadership and communication can be a challenge
yes i can abide work to these rules
subsequent rescreening of secondary records during the review and reading process
all of these require the teacher to be fully prepared before class
like one member in our group he will always happy to help us to finished all the situation
the lecturers in each of my modules have done a great job of making the contents of the lecture clear by firstly introducing the topic at the start of the lecture and at the end of every lecture quickly discussing what we would be doing next time
i will take the initiative to help them solve their learning and life difficulties
the main difference for me is time management
in my own country we have a learning habit that is to do preparation before the lecture and do some review after the lecture
some of lecturers use very humour way to attract students attention such as saying some relative jokes telling us some interesting stories and so on
the difficulty of learning it used to be easy to deal with but now it takes more time to learn5
i am pleased about the programme formation
bidyut noel and other tutors and phd brought useful skills for me including how to use library system or stimulated creativity during group work which are helpful for our task and presentation4
however i believe i would deal with troubles
the lecturers often tell a lot of relevant background knowledge in the lectures as well as recommending some reference books or websites so that we can better understand the content of their lectures in class or off class
sometimes tutors speak slowly to let us adjust their rhythm
overtimesnotes made me during lectures or selfstudy have proven tobe reliable and helpful in assignment or homework
in order to make students group cooperative learning carry out in an orderly and effective manner students must have a clear task of learning
working in groups help us enhance the spirit of cooperation
at the very beginning it is difficult for me to take the whole important content down as i am not a native english speaker and i have tried to take down every important detail but i failed
the graduation rate in china can reach 98 percent or even more that means our chinese students dont have too much pressure to graduate
so student is not supposed to involve something about the personal habit or favorites in the learning progress
obviously classmates are different5
and the lectures usually speak quickly there is little time for me to take notes
there are many discussion in one classwe can communicate more and get more understandingthe relationship whether between students and students or between students and teachers could be better
for example an enterprise job is to create a new company so the entire job contains many aspects of the companys affairs
helped the use and memory of theoretical knowledge
now i will preview the ppt before class print out the ppt and write down the important content directly in blank of slide
thirdly i believe that i should have more communication with my lecturers and be brave to express own opinions and confuse no matter in class or after class
well i want to talk about several partsfirst
one day i will not be at a loss when i find my dream
i feel my time flies all of a sudden i have been in the week 10 the last week in term 1
there is no doubt we all have strengths and weakness
in the face of academic work due todifferent educational backgrounds during the teamwork i did not have enoughprofessional knowledge to help my team partner and what i can guarantee is thati would not trouble the outstanding students
so now i have no scruple only full of enthusiasm to face every day
these will make our work less efficient
i dont just need to learn i also need to participate in some extracurricular activities
in fact i think our group works well together
due to the different significance of the notes i take down different amount of notes
in the marketing of technology class when the teacher talked about the brand effect showed us some brands on the market as evidence to help us understand the knowledge
in the lecture of international business dr john has given us some information about
teachers only tell students the deadline and only use the last class to talk about the requirements and matters needing attention related to homework
for example some team members are not good at programming but have more abilities in managementat the same time different practical situations should also be considered
i think i am confident in coping with the academic work because i completed the presessional programme beforeduring the presessional coursei learned a lot about the academic workfor examplei learned how to write a report and how to give a academic poster or presentationi also learnt to how to search sources for my academic workthe most important thing i learned from the presessional programme was about plagiarismsometimesplagiarism may be unintentionalhowever i must avoid plagiarismin order to avoid plagiarismi must rephrase sources and add referencesthe only one thing i may be worried about during the academic work is that i may make mistakes in writing since i am not native english speakerhoweveri still think i can cope with the academic work
but we cant follow othersblindly
they use rich body language and detailed preparation to show how to complete a perfect presentation
these are some bad habits of me and i  m trying to correct them
many things that existed in the imagination have become reality but i dont have so much imagination
i will go back to the music study and study i will go to the gym
this helps the team get the job done and achieves a clear goal
after all a persons strength is always limited to complement the worki should use all the resources and talents which can motivate team members in the future to cooperate with others and make the advantages of team work
when we talk about our team work most of them do not have their own opinion
after being explained by this way i can have a better understanding
that is great6
because i used to study at safety engineeringse which is more likely to engineering and technology comparing with engineering managementem
i feel that most of the times the objective is clear or otherwise the objective is more complex to understand and becomes clearer in time with more reading labs and workshops
through the interaction of the group and interesting cooperation so that students who do not learn will follow the learning and progress is excellent other members of the team to encourage the enthusiasm for learning will rise the performance of genetic improvement3 through group cooperation improve learning efficiency optimise learning methods
sorry i cant
every teacher is eager to communicate with us
and in software respect difference is bigger although the campus network of china builds pretty good the effect difference that invests capital and gets has a bit big the student is not very humanised when using use rate is lower
in this following year i will try my best to obtain the knowledge try to learn the working skills
so i have to say a lot of things quickly
in my studies i will join a writing practice course to improve the upcoming final task
we would either watch tv or netflix or end up going out into york
i used some questions to make my audiences get into my presentatinos and use body languages to let them know what i want to show them
i can have a lot of new information from the lecture and improve the skills what i need to use in a presentation
in particular when you are prep you will encounter new words so you will go to the query and memorize so when the class is mentioned those words you will become very sensitive
besides cars here are all in the left side when running
there may be many reasons for this but i think that it is usually caused by a lack of positive attitude towards work
when i am taking notes i usually use pens in different color to show different levels
communication compromise tolerance and reliability are important
so it is challenging for a person to finish the homework but there are six people in our group so it will be easy and efficient for you to work together to complete this job
after the induction programme i really look forward to my courses
she did not use notes in class
what i feel is most important for every group is to communicate when its necessary
i was a supervisor in mining company projectarea
becausei attended some courses which has some topic of management of technology
so i am lucky to have teachers like joanna north and noel jackson who has been teaching us with their own practical experience5grow your language skillswhatever you study language and communication are essential components for success
in my opinion people with different personalities can promote each other in the one group which means we can play our respective strengths in the assignment and get great grade
for my current collaborative learning i always pay more attention to team harmony
also you can walk around to give explanations to the illustrations you have posted on the slide
actually there are different behaviours that i had ever never seen before i came to yorkfirstly in our classes some students who are always active usually answer questions taken by tutors
finally they should consider the details of the speech and they should pay attention to the logical order of the content
maybe under the tempation of money i will break the rea ethical principles
and the most important thing in team work is being respect everyone need to respect others idea and pay attention when they are sharing their idea
this is not a good habit because sometimes people at least for me could not be able to make right decision immediately
i can easily to join the lectures however i expect more seminar for our course
i try to do all the things i want
even when the questions are presented the teacher will answer them patiently and work with us to solve the problems
lecturer will according to the overall goals atthe same time or test goal to discuss decomposition for example in theprogramming class has the whole project of the matchfor theorycourses as for all theory courses it is boring because some of the standarddefinitions and classification
i really like how everything about sound starts becoming more scientific
fifth compared to before
and when others are making a speech we should be quiet and show some respect
i have confidence in myself and will do my best to achieve my goals
these three challenges are preventing me frombeing a distinction grade studentbefore i came to the uk i was addicted to playingcomputer games and it affected my normal life
i am very envious of every teachers freedom on the stage not nervous
in a class lecture for an hour not every student can be engrossed in the class
all the lecture are all quiet familiar with what they taught because they have research topic in these field
whenever a student has a question they will hear the question carefully and offer the answer immediately helping students to solve the problem
another friend of me jin seems like a kind elder brother who can provide the right suggestions at the right time and he can keep claim in any emergent situationsi think both of their behaviors can contribute to success
the content of marketing of technology is simple and clear and easy to understandpersonal effectiveness and masterclasses have clear goalsenterprise content is clear
it might have been a lot more useful for the students coming from different universities and courses
iwrote down a lot of notes and i sometimes felt that i am losing time because ido not review my notes
without communication nobody would know their place and their strengths and weaknesses within that team
1 listening to others clearly and trying to understand others when they speaking
i think it could be more interaction
the only difference from the formal one is that there was no camera to recordat that time we all were shocked and began to worry about it as sarah said each presentation should last for at least ten minutes and request us move away our laptops and mobile phones
boshu jinhe is a very good leader
in the past the education i received was purely professorial which is not suitable for me
i have learned a lot herenow i can read the materials in the library alone i can study alone in the study room and i also can actively communicate with the teacher after the class by mail
for examplein the marketing management class the lecturer used the familiar mcdonalds orkfc to explain the 4p mix
in the second group work we needed to make a device to transfer a bottle of water at least 3 meters at that time firstly all of us tried to find out a horizontal route to transfer the bottle however we found it quite difficult then a teammate said if we can change our mind and find another way for example a vertical route
dont forget to save the page before you finishhow do you feel about the msc in amtmake notes in the boxes below about the questions and any other observations you have on the first sessiondo you think it will be what you expected
1 using humour in the lecture to catch the attention of the audience2
during the variation of powerpoint slides lecturers could always create connections to the next slides and lead us move from one point to the next by using some sentences next we will talking about
only in this way can i reallylearn some knowledge that will be helpful to my future career and successfullycomplete my postgraduate study
we have more ideas when facing problems and feel more confident because we know that we can solve the difficulties together
i learn how to use eyes to communicate with others and use some words to make the presentation become humor
therefore we always have smooth and natural communications
i am happy with the induction session
i can hear all the lecturer clearly and the slides were clear enough
in my case because of theeducation in china students need to studied really hard to get into the universityhowever the students can graduated more easier than get into school
you can advise the opinion what you think more effective and correct than theirs but personally
i think what we need to do first is to set a goal and then we can work hard to get the goal
learning more initiative
every should engage the strategy of group work because decision is made by leader but produced by all members4
another thing is some people are quite shy
they are very patient and careful to answer my question
i have failed these principles several timesduring the five years
the speech style of each tutor is different
my way of taking notes is to write down some key sentences and keywords as well as my own questions
they have abilities to control everything in their lecture
they always answer my questions
if i have much more time i can notfocus on my homework earlier which i think it is the biggest problem formyself
however i reallyrejected them because it was against my ethic
i was in a situationthat a group of people are been affected by bad moods and became nonproductivei have been working for nearly 6 years bynow before join this program i was working in the overseas department of chinainternational telecommunication construction corp design institute
in the previous stage of undergraduate study tend to come into contact with many new knowledge such as python and javascript for the first time i was choice is to search on the internet related knowledge or document copy the code to test sometimes its hard to say i did not violate the good faith principle because i did not note the source from where there is only one line of codeon the other hand the principle rae wants to protect the environment of human society which is beneficial to the public
yes i think we need more selfregulation of learning
communicate and learn in a nonnativelanguage7
i dont want those things to happen to people around me
fortunately this week i did the first english presentation in people
in classroom we could ask questions or express different views at any time and lecturers are also pleasure to answer and discuss with student which is another difference
besidesour tutors also keep close contact with us and we can keep high contration on his course
so often i will write homework day and night several nights before the deadline
a regular living habit could bring us more energy i guess i need to pay attention to my living habit
and the differences of the individual style will make the group more energetic when faced with some big challenges
plus sometimes i make the same mistakes
i will abide the principles accurately and make my working life professional and righteous
whenever we get a new construction project the project was divided into many small parts and completed by different sectors
in the lecture of international business dr john is really a humorous person
if one person can not persuade the other one that hisopinion is correct they are more likely to argue over one issue and stop theother
for example the lecture of law of business cause every lecture has different teacher to give hard to adjust
and we share music knowledge together to achieve music without borders 8
the teacher will teach all the content
when i first came i was not used to this kind of learning model
in addition a bad internal relationship in a group will also lead to failure
preview i seldom preview before
however i didnt like going to the library
i can tell you something about the lecturer i love them very much i enjoy their courses
the lecturers are different in every session
seems like a fairly standard academic environment to me
there will always be eye contact and interaction in the classroom between the teacher and the studentthe only downside is that there may be something in the class that you dont understand maybe because of english
when i combined theory with practice i found some unethical experiences
whats more i can obey these principles during i am a student in the university
i think its important to respect each others suggestions in the group discussion and know how to draw good parts from each others suggestions
at the same time i think the social media will effect my studying life it will make can not have the will powerin addition sometimes i am not willing to accept difficulties i am afraid of the unknown
clear voice4
i used to have classes in normalflat classrooms
i really enjoy the team work but in the other hands i am a little bit introverted
however after i came to york 70 of my classmates around me had working experience and their ages varied greatly which made it difficult to agree on many views
all lecturers seem to really like what they are working with and the excitement most of the time gets passed on to the audience
by observing my classmates i found my classmates can be divided into three groups according to their daily behaviour in class
i expect that the chinese studentsin my class including me should be more positive
the result was that i didnt have enough time to spend in each module and most of the times my works wasnt at the level that i wanted
i think this kind of immersion teaching method is what i expected so that i can participate more in the classroom
yes i am very much looking forward to the course in engineering management
foreign teaching is relatively free and can give students thinking
their slides are clear
there are some students who study very well
i am used to discuss ideas with my classmates
i found that the induction programme was most useful as an opportunity to get to know the students that i will be studying with this year
distractions may be unavoidable but good control must be exercised to avoid this3
since i had taken a oneyear preparatory course at university of york i could see the huge difference between a postgraduate course and a postgraduate course
most of lectures have great logic and are well organized
conflicts between team members3team members can not coordinate well
i used to like to use outline method to take notes down
however in many cases they have different opinion
although the lecture only has 50 minutes but it contains large amount of knowledge which covers almost every aspect of certain technology or theory
second expressing your own thoughts is also very essential it can make your team members know your ideas and your opinion when others are express their ideas be patient and if their opinions are different with yours，communicate with others in time
and the reading tasks are left to students to finish separately
i think the three elements that determine success are hard work persistence and modesty
the lecturer of current modules in dse are quiet good
every lecturer has different accent but it can be overcame after getting used to ithowever we have our first and second law lectures in the central hall and we seat on the stairs so it was hard to see the screen and hear the teacher clearly
in se almost all the course is assessed by examination but in em just finacial will be examed
all of these actions will greatly promote the success of thecooperationon the other hand it can not be ignoredthat negative behavior is difficult to remove
next professor continue to talk about the law from several other engineeringrelated aspects
i think i am not good sometimes i will miss the point of the knowledge
all my group mates are very friendly and nicethey have different specialities for example one of the girls is good at social contact who can let us know each other faster as for one of the boys his undergraduate major was civil engineering which can improve our efficiency in the game of the tower
in this test i showed that i tend to play coorinator and monitor evaluator in teamwork both of which are very similar to my own personality
i think it is very essential to be humble and project your strengths in the right moment
management is a very simple thing to say but really want to go deep understanding and learning will often be different
also i am a little rush and impatient about mistakes
as errors may occur in the study changing results may occur in order to reduce the number of studies
i think it will be a serious and rigorous year of studyas i have learned some basic knowledge during my undergraduate study i can communicate with team members technically and i will have some new ideas and i look forward to sharing with them in my study
in china basically every parts of courses finished by a single student
members of a team need to be able to convey their ideas to one another in order to teach the group certain things and let other members know when they may be causing problems for constructive criticism or indeed to receive praise when a job is done well
i was happy that we are provided many opportunities to have interaction with teachers and classmates which not only improve my english speaking but also encourage me thinking a lot
although is stands on the platform to lecture but also needs the profound knowledge accumulationthe second is communication with students
compared with what i have experienced in the past this style is not newbut it divided the students into groupsand every group has its own supervisor
as well as how can we organize our words
in my graduate study in china most of our class is the lecture
as for living environment i am gradually accustomed to the weather and food in uk which can help me concentrate more on my studying careerwhen it comes to the major differences between my first degree and the msc in em at york here are some points that i can list below1 teaching language i was taught in chinese in my first degree and now its english2
i think they are deiligent and reliable
lecturers used interactive teaching methods to help people to think
and i also have some eye contact with them excepts they want to find some students to answer their questions which i really have no idea
absolutely yes the lecture can be delivered from teacher to me clearlyi can hear the lecturer and i also sit in the first and second line of classroom so i can listen to lecturers voice loudly
i think it is a bad habitto not take notes in class
during the group assignment we have a time to communicate with each other share our own knowledge and integrate it together
after getting up they will start to read some books learn some other knowledge or do some sports to make themselves more energetic
jin had worked for 5 years before came to yorkhe is good at manager a teamhis passion and effective origination make me more energetic in teamwork
what success
during this period although i already tried my best to achieve this aim there are still have some factors can impact my learning
i swear i was not a person who likes to share ideas with others
yes the speaking speed of the lecturer is appropriate
if necessary he will show me the evidence of why i should do some thing like he suggest
most of the accommodations in taiwan do not contain kitchens or share kitchens with others
i can not debate or my opinion could besuperficial for example this happens sometimes in classes of law forengineering
i felt endless power on him
the lecturers often interact with us they ask questions but sometimes we are ashamed to answer and they dont have to continue to ask
but ill try
some students sorry i dont know their names
yes i think this is what i expected
maybe there wont be any dangerous things at the time but it is a threat to the safety of others in the future or the surrounding environmentfor example when we supervised the construction of a house the negligence of some details may cause the house to collapse in a few years and may be a large number of casualtiesfor example when we supervised the construction of a house the negligence of some details may cause the house to collapse in a few years and may be a large number of casualtieswhat we should do is to be responsible for our work and others and treat everything with sincerity
i can learn a lot from the merits of themwhen they meet some difficulties in study i will try my best to help them
every lecture teacher i have studied is very talented
teachers usually dont use notes they can skillfully remember what they want to introduce
so the efficiency has been improvedand every student can get more attention
can get to some professionals
secondly body language and eye contact are also important
he is very patient and very clear when answering questionsjns voice is very loud and the pronunciation is very clear and very slow
i found that it is really hard to get distinction grade
i think i also have another bad habit which maybe prevent me to be a distinction student
my previous study life was only learning and i spent all my time doing learning
they use some simple gestures or mood words to help the audience understand the speech
homework is not willing to do it by themselves
everyone has different majors and different thinking stylesso they have different ways and habits to solve the problem
is interesting to have classes in these newfacilities5 online resources university of york uses a lot ofonline tools like this elog to evaluate and foster the learning process in aninteractive way6 administrative assignments maybe for the nature of myundergraduate studies the assignments always were focused in the technicalaspects of the engineering more than the administrative pathway
a successful collaborative learning is supposed to improve every group members ability during the process of the team work
in groupmeeting everyone needs talk about own opinion but after listened othersopinion i am afraid my opinion is not good and also afraid other would thinkthis opinion is less useful
staffs staffs in our department are being very nice and helping
after class i will focus on reviewing them
there is connection between different knowledge
for example i learnt of style of motivation when students areboring in class
i felt very guilty at the time
therefore for thelearning style i personally think that it is necessary to have selfdisciplineand what is the basic needson the other hand the educational style isdifferent between china and uk
and how to find reliable content online as a reference
he always does the eye contact with us either
so i personally think that this is not the main reason that will affect my study
yes and more
when i did my finalundergraduate project i like to work in the lab making the experiment and likethe feeling when i find out the result
in my former study when i need to write an essay i usually get into the plagiarism troubles
when the group has a certain amount of coordination going it is surely going to be a success
how can you help them achieve their goals
i am planning to make the best out of the opportunities and chances that are given to me during the duration of the course
i think there will be some challenges in my group about how to summarize several thoughts into one result i will do my best to let my teammates to have more discussions and come up the answers which can be convinced by all
as a person having noticed this challenge i have a called a meeting on how to improve our communication skills in english language so as to enable the group work going on without hindrances
however when i came to york i found it difficult to take notes in the class for the reasons that i can not divert my attention from listening to the lecturer to take notes
i think yes
however there are some lecture so professional which means it is difficult for me to understand all the content so clearly like low for engineering management
i am very satisfied with the campus s comprehensive learning equipment and the library materials are also very abundant
i tend to employ this method along with other recording methods
thus conflict is inevitable
and for the activities should be added from my point of view it is the introduction of the culture of britain because the foreigners are interested in the different culture here
roleplaying is vital in the team and believes in others as well
however i found some main differences between us via the progress of our class
of course this will reduce my learning efficiency
but i felt it impolite to interrupt him
as the mother once told me the opportunity is always for those who are preparedin fact i think that i am a person who can complete the current tasks with high quality
after reading these four fundamental principles for ethical behaviour and decisionmakingalthough it said that it is neither a regulation nor a standard
they just use slides to teach content and i rarely find that they use comparison to teach
the lecturers always referenced some data and they may use some charts to persuade audiences
sometimes they look like thinking a word to explain the terms to us
this along with staying enthusiastic about the subject and doing as much extra reading as possible will hopefully push me into the distinction boundary
thats pretty interesting and we learn more about the different culturesmanagement and marketing of technology this course is divided into two classesmanagement of technology and marketing of technology and the course is taught by noel and bidyut
after induction week it was made clear that some of my assumptions were correct yet differ when it comes to the course structure as well as how assignments are set
how can they help you to achieve your study goals for the programme
i have a general understanding of the moral laws of british engineers after i have seen the rae ethics
however there are some disadvantages
but in my first degree we focused only to read books so thats the main difference i feel here
team relies on not only strength of the collective discussion or decision making and information sharing it emphasizes the joint contributions of member
and i will try to learn from others advantages
when i reread my notes i did notunderstand very well my notes
in other words my notes are illogical and it is difficult to understand
practicing knowledge
as a result efficiency will be greatly improved in later team workin my opinion different challenge thefirst thing to do yourself do your best to help the team achieve the goalsecond try to become familiar with the competencies of the different groups ofcrews and collaborate appropriately
the lecturer can always give us some examples to make us have a deep knowledge of the moduleand they can give us some backgrounds to help us move from one points to the next
i can clearly understand the skeleton of every lecture through their first several slides
after gradual adaptation the rules that usually need to be recorded are summarized
in addition we dont have exams and thus i dont need to memorize concepts
consequently i take notes in chinese and then translate it to english after class
i think it will be an interesting learning experience
do you think you can work to these principles during your taught msc and in your working life as an engineering manager
they can also do some marks in the slide and if some words they dont understand
to sum up i can basically cope with my academic work and i relatively recognise my approach
it takes much time for a person to do difficult homework alone and a group discussion can save time and the interest of the team members is thicker
communication can help us know what the other person is thinking
so in some courses i barely take notes
i can see evidence from the website links videobooks and some reading materials that the teachers show us on the vle or showon the classes
this is what i need to improve in future life i think because i have seen many other students are used speaking english in lectures although english is not their first language
first i will keep friendly with my all team members so that we can communicate effectively second i will know more about my team members know their habits strength and weakness then they can be allocated the tasks reasonably in the future when assigning tasks
after this first session and introduction week i think i made a great choice for myself which is to carry on this msc program
like i mentioned above i always took lots of notes during the lecture and sometimes i might get distracted by taking notes
usually at four or five o clock in the morning there were people waiting in line at the gate of the library
i will seek real feedback from them which will allow me to quickly realize my weaknesses and improve them
the standards of study is more serious compared with that in undergraduate study
i did not have many experience like these before while i have had some experience in class now
in order to avoid these challenges becoming problems first i can do is to respect everyone
when the lecturer introduced a subject heshe always showed us some statistics or some literature reviews about the subject which i think is very professional and helpful to our understanding
therefore i do like the teaching style here and thats one of the reasons why i choose to study abroad
at the beginning it may be difficult to understand some professional vocabularies but the humorous teaching methods of the lecturers made me better fit into it
the results of the speech are very good and the instructors often have exchanges with us especially eye contact
however at present i still need to improve in many aspects
actually it is no longer a problem for me at present
agreement is an other important factor
yes i think so i feel excited and expecting for it
compared with reading academic books or article i prefer entertainment news sports news or novel which can make me feel very well and relax myself although i know these are all useless for my academic work
as i mentioned before teaching methodshere are quite different from where i used to study
the other candidate was more capable but we also voted for him
on the contrary some students spend a little time on studying and do not review the classes which will hinder the success
there are a lot of information will be found
from the induction sessions i did notice the enthusiasm in the lecturers and i hope this continues throughout the year as it makes me more motivated to do well
yes，i believe this course will help me to prepare for my career
reference smith bl
writing is a very important thing for them so they improve a little every day and the more the article is written the better the text qualitythe third quadrant is urgent but not important
secondly we will have different progress in the work
although the boy in my group devote much time to our group he is not willing to communicate with others friendly
grow together in the process of mutual supervision and encouragement
because there are only two of them are here i could not make an accurate identification about them
although there are too many chinese students in msc in em there are still several nonchinese students and we need to have communication with them making it not to be a simply chinese school3 reading list
the construction game is impressive i am happy with the induction programme which give me a lot of valuable information
and try to allocate my free time
and when we work together if we can take advantages from everyone and make up for everyones disadvantages we will achieve the best efficiency in our group
it has always been possible for me to hear the lecturers clearly although almost of the lectures have taken place in a small room with a small number of students so it was not particularly likely to have note been the case
they gave me a lot of help in learning ability and expression
there could be some misunderstand in same sentence
secondly introversion to be honest i really dont like introversion because it prevent me to make new friends and get some good opportunities to express myself
the schools library has abundant resources and complete hardware facilities
as for life i gradually overcome the languagebarrier and start to like the food here
first of all the teachers speaking speed is moderate the volume is just right there will be no unclear situation
from those afternoon sessionsi knew more about my programmei think academci skills session was most helpfulif possibleit could be added more
it is surprised for me to meet those interesting teachers
whats more there are so many vocabularies are too difficult to understand with the google translate translation to my own language
i am scheduling each course and i amprioritizing according timetable presentation of report
i think that i didn  t apply myself in some extraordinary way to the new environment
to be specific we will learn some basic skills such as using word powerpoint and presentation skills
how do you reward yourself when youcomplete a big jobread thestrategies of good engineering management readers link at the bottom ofthis page click the download arrow to download and add instructions
in the future study we must always work with our partners to learn from each other and promote each other
in china teachers mainly talk about knowledge points and students take notes in class
reading listin china i didnt have any reading list6
in china some interactions are missing from the management class
jhon issitt responded good my questions
through induction programme i learned that my course will also cover a lot of practical and technical learning which is what i expect for this course although i may not be very good at operating computer related tasks
they follow a logical structure that is easy to keep up with each slide is self contained with a clear heading but links to the previous and next slide
there is no experiment of engineering management course6
the purpose of forming a team is to work together
after that i carefully prepared this presentation again
the challenges may lay down to the lack of awareness of privacy and also being ambiguous in communication
answerquestions when you answer someone  s questions it is better for you to repeatthe questions again in order to make the questions more clear
i seldom remember very clearly or write down what the teacher said
l participated in the 4week presessional program so it is 3 months for meas to the teaching style the most surprising point is the requirements for the assignments are more careful about the comprehensive development of the students
what i care most is how well my academic work really is
every lecture i take notes for is dated titled and kept in a notebook and reviewed as necessary
i think the most important qualities in a team are good communication and mutual understanding
personally as a postgraduate student we should concentrate while tutor is talking and showing powerpoint slides and take notes simultaneously
i think that good communication is an essential factor for successful collaborative learning
sometimes it makes a negative impact on my study
every time i get a mission on my study or some daily work i often forget how to make a good timetable
maybe sometimes playing games can help us relax and this also is a form of entertainment but when i play too much it is addictive games not conducive to learning
but gradually i realized it is impossible for me and i will miss some key information when i just focus on taking notes
hui has good manipulative abilitywen and qi are good at expressingdan has good ability of organization
i have found good characteristics for this course in two friends one from spain and another from indiato foster success in the masters studiesassist to all the lecturesperform the required activities by the teacherscontinuous work for the works expected by weeks close to the end of the termto not limit the knowledge to the classroom go beyond look for the answers in the books in the web discuss with the classmateslook for a good lifework balancein the other hand i have met some people from china that fits with the following statements to hinder successno put attention to the lectureslet that the homeworks stacks up without addressing them appropriatelyplay games in the classrooms while the teacher is trying to explain somethingpoor commitment with workteam
unfortunately i can not study well about this subject because i lost many details from the teacher mouth
because china has a large student population the form of education is entirely different
thus i think spend time to improve english level is better than catch study program after class and i hope i can achieve this idea in the future
different people belong to different kindsthe same thing is that our goals should be the same we need to work together in one teambut different roles in one team is also necessarywe need to take on different responsibilitiessuch as the leader and team worker
their english is better
i like them really
in an overall scale they are ok
everyone needs to understand other peoples opinions and learn to respect and encourage each other
team work abilityhaving goodteamwork can not only improve the efficiency of collaborative learning but alsohelp each other improve their professional knowledge2
one of best way to write ideas is usinggraphics so that ideas can be accepted or rejected
so thats only a small suggestion in my opinion
it is absolutely logic
the induction programme is great
ln the usual time l make sure l make it clear that l have understood every term mentioned in the lecture
therefore i will try to extract the key words and record them when i take notes in class maybe this can not only improve the efficiency of lectures but also improve the concentration of lecturesbecause the record is very comprehensive when i review the notes i can easily recall the content of the class
they are very diligent in doing things they are very thoughtful they always think about the issues very well and they can organize each group discussion very well
4in terms of teaching methods yorks teaching is more open and free students can ask questions at any time in class if we have any questionsin china teachers pay more attention to the absolute silence of the class5for the teaching content i studied em in both undergraduate and postgraduate studies but the content i studied in undergraduate was more inclined to science subjects such as structural mechanics while in york the learning content was more inclined to liberal artssuch as marketing and management6before i lived in the dormitory i used to have classes and eat meals with my classmates but now i live in a studio alone so i have to learn to live independently to my delight i finally learned to cook7yorks life pace is slow comparing to many cities in china i can enjoying spending the whole afternoon enjoying the afternoon tea or just browsing the streets of york
again collaborative implies that it isnt onesided and if both parties share knowledge that will help them both fill gaps in their knowledge
try to not be shy is my goal in this year
secondly modesty and respect are necessary it is helpful to relationship of teammate
however i saw that most of them are interested in music recording and producing
everyone has their own benefits also have shortages
if i want to get distinguish grade the most important thing is to look at your assignment because tutors have already written the mark point on the vle had better read it
however in the first i often fail to keep up with teachers mind
so learning to cooperate is the most important thing
efficiency and high quality should not only stay in the target stage but also be realised in our collaborative work
because we are not the same country we have different languages and my english is not good we have difficulty to communicate each other
i used to have up to 12 modules in the same term semester in that case
i prefer to be a coordinatoras group we are going to work very well because i can see that each of us have different talent
although i may forget that easily i can remind those memories easily
after classes there is always plenty of time to work by myself at home
at the university of york the teachers answered the issues in the emails sent by us quickly which reduced the time cost
during my study i learnt how to reading efficiently during a limited time and some skills during writing like harvard style
by using suitable interactions can get every students involved in class and make them concentrate on the topic
they are not willing to make the concessions
it is worthy to say that my study way is not good actually i always think that it is low efficient i need to spend more time to review the knowlege and i do not know the key content
when people in a group dont communicate with each other
sometimes i make it but unfortunately i dont
the law course mentioned above the guest lecturer invited in these two weeks maybe i prefer the instruction of my professional teacher or perhaps because the guest lecturer himself is a lawyer and is serious
and i should use pictures related to the content of the speech to help the audience understand the content of the speech more easily
most of lecturers will specify topic of every lecture and give out the key point and powerpoint slides in advanced which can help me easily study by myself if i cant fully understand knowledge in class
in my opinion tolerance is the most important factor
york has been now my home for almost 3 months
we  ll be learning under some truly inspirational individuals from all kinds of backgrounds each with their own unique passions industry experiences and approaches to your subject
although there are all chinese in my team there are still some divergences of opinions as we have different education backgrounds and family backgroundssometimes its hard to change someone elses established view towards something
however as my future work requires my study plan must cover this part which requires me to look for school resources and online help
they have wonderful lecture for me
first of all i have to define my own strengths and play my own strengths in the work of the group
like some of the classmates who i mentioned above
in conclusion everything is perfect in the lecture
for example absentee meetings even profit byother peoples toil do not respect the way others work
we will continue to improve ourselves in the continuous obstacles to achieve the ultimate success
management amp marketing of technology is well evidenced with sourced information and the lecturers show their career experiences early on in the course
i think every lectures are designed carefully the lecture always include some interesting content like pictures video and some talk
for example i used to review every key points or theory after one days class after finishing my dinner
be responsibility
and the group work is one of the differences
for example reading is important but reading can be effective and need enough time to prepare
many people were watching this speech at the time
my groupmates are very kind and work hard i believe we can do a good a job with each others support
i feel that different subjective perceptions of each member influence teamwork
generally it is good all lecturers have reasonable logic and they can express their ideas clearly in the classes
but now i know that in my course there are a physician or an electronic engineer who can help me easily with that
however i hope i can overcome these low eficiency habits and improve myself during my study at the university of york
my impression is very deep
make notes it is to carry out teaching material commonly deepen memory be helpful for reviewing there are also supplementary teaching material content rich knowledge
surely there will be different people and different environment in the future but is really beneficial to get basics right before we move forward
organization of my notes are always the same from basics to more complex ideas
or i will take a lot of photos so i will record faster and the content will be more complete
yesi cani think the biggest challenge is we always have no effective time management to finish our assignmentsso we always use some dishonest behavior to finish our assignments before the deadline
after finishing inductions i think the most helpful activities was using paper to build a high and stable tower
the tutor can be really kind and accessible
however as long as i keep doing what i am doing and turning up to every lecture making notes and completing all of the work i am set i am certain i will achieve at least a merit
i seldom take notes in most classes
because of my speaking problem i always fear asking questions
if i want to work as a group i need respect my partners and respect their viewpoints
there must be successful interpersonal communication in the group
starting from cooking to managing your schedule to even washing your clothesit is really a good learning curve in my life3
it is typical to chase chat and wander
being a successful manager that i must to learn how to overcome the problems and opinions in the team
almost all class in europe and the united states are allowed to use electronic devices which has both advantages and disadvantages
basically we finish the individual work which requested by teachers
i think most of classmates are friendly
sometimes the lecture will say a theory or a conclusion directly without any derive steps
in the meantime many of our teachers have many good management experiences i think i can learn a lot about what a company real do and what kind of employer they really need
deep gap between group members
yes no advice
in china my teacher gave us specific deadlines for a course which means i have the clear timetable provided by my teacher
just 8 o clock lie down for a while then snore till 10 o clock get up and have supper at noon
environmental design is considerate technical work
it can be difficult for me to write the report at first but with the practice of the elearning log my writing skills improved rapidly
sometimes i feel a little embrrassed when talking to him
noel is the most patient teacher from my point of view and i have sent several emails to him to ask some technical problems he replies the email as quick as possible
and sometimes good jokes make people relax and more willing to listen
this willtest the role of different people in the group with the leader in charge ofplanning the thinker in charge of brainstorming and others in charge ofputting it into practice
for instance our group do the assignment seriously in each course so that we have a opportunity to do presentation in strategic management
once i had a speech competitionas it was just a recreational competition i did not pay much attention to iti started to prepare the speech the day before the competition while others prepared a week in advance
in addition if professor speak quickly in the lecture it is a little difficult to understand clearlyin conclusion these two factors are the main factors which can impact i become the grade student
with people from various part of the world and diverse backgrounds we have started to gain a lot of information about the various cultures and even exchange languages
lecturers would check that whether students at the back of the classroom can hear his or her voice at the beginning of the lecture every time
my knowledge has simply borrowed from the existing design to assist me in completing
i am very curious why the engineering management is planned in the electronic engineering department
for example negotiations on important projects important meetings etcthe second quadrant is not urgent and many things have to be done in a very relevant preparation before they happen
after five weeks of study i found that every teacher was well prepared before class
i need to go deep into understanding and learning every course that i learn
this is a very interesting question as i completed my undergraduate study in the same university and department
so weshould focus on solve the problem rather than other things
i like the activity of making a paper tower and personality tests
i need to integrate myself into it and understand what the teacher wants to express
yes it is but i still want to learn something about engineering not just management
for example in the course of international business the teacher started with cultural differences and analyzed the development of international economic forms which made me understand a lot of etiquette and problems that should be paid attention to in international business
i would like to say thanks to my group members
whats more in the future when i enter enterprise and do my work collaborative work is also important and basic in some big working assignments which help us make personal contributions in own skilled area and improve the efficiency of team work
i will do as much reading and indepthinvestigation as possible to ensure the rigor of my paper
i can listen carefully in class but i lack critical thinking
besides the time to focus on our study and writing the essay i also need to balance the time for daily life i need to take good care of myself4
i think the business plan we should do in teams is a specific challenges its a very interesting subjectwe need to start it at zero
now it is the afternoon of this friday i come to the school library with my friend
i admit that there are some challenges like always acting with care and risk management but i will do my best to overcome them in my career
i think the most important thing is refusing authoritarian
in the international business class i have read the book ltinternational businessgt writen by collinson sionm
with the time spent arguing with group members or trying to plan good days to meet up and work on the project together learning about the subject matter is often greatly reduced
practice
more hard using more critical thinking always adjusting the way of studyingkeep reading keep critical thinking
learning styles
this will also speed up the learning processthe internetthe internet is undoubtedly the fastest way to search and receive information at present
vote a leader and follow him
so persons can study or make an investigationabout the topic before we are going to have meeting
yes，i think em is the course what i want to learn
but i will do my best to complete it
it gave me a buffer period before the official classand especially the class about critical thinking and writing skills helped me a lot
i was doing most of my homework which were almost meeting deadline
during the course of the professional course i was able to learn the update of the professional knowledge required by the society as well as the development and revolution of the background of professional knowledge
i can understand very well to them
i sould learn from them and i believe that we both can success
i definitely prefer the smaller class size as it feels more appropriate to ask questions and engage more with the lecturer
moreover the knowledge for every class can be used into the case study in the last part so it can be called logical
to ensure i can understand every important point or theory when lecturers will talk about on next day i will make some previous reading to some relevant articles and report to find some basic information
that can make me save a lot of time during my study life in york
humour was used to help us relax and improve our efficiency of learning and it was very common in our lectures especially in international business
on the induction session i joined the discussion and provided my ideas
the second question is about whether the lecturer can be heard clearly
the ways and means of expressing opinions will be different
they are really professional and answer the questions with some key points
every assessment will be an excellent opportunity to level up myself with the feedback report
of course these slides have been uploaded on the internet in advance so that we could preview and review
to fit with these i have to make some necessary efforts as an international studentfor the differences between my bachelor degree and the msc at york the followings are points that i would say1
this affects team work due to the language barriers that are present as it takes more effort to address a part of a task between two different cultures as opposed to a group where each member originate from one culture
there are many factors that lead to the failure of cooperationfor example some people lack initiative
yesit isi like the level of interaction very much
i have a little knowledge in the coursesbecause i have experience in management of project
initiallyevery member had their own ideas and we could communicate together which can stimulate our thinking activity and logical thinking stylesecondlyeachone had their strengths and drawbacks if we work together we could show our strengths and alter our drawbacks at the same time we could also learn each other in a group because all of my members were friendlyenthusiastic and positiveso i can receive positive energy during our project finallywe spoken english during our droup rather than chinese when we argued questions in this way we could improve our speaking and enhance our communication skills in english at the same time it is beneficial for our language studying in my point more practice more perfect
everybody listenedwhen one of the member was talking
first of all everyone is doing their best to work
every detail from slide production to speech is very worth learning
in the group activities i realized the importance of creativity and teamwork in this subject
for example how to deal with the division of labor of the team to achieve the most efficient and perfect processing and completion of the operation
on the other hand manage cashflow also plays important role in business
social media may be another cause of failure
the lecturers slide is very clear
before starting a new section we should do a brief conclusion and introduce the new sectionfinally the space of the presentation is really important and you should always put a smile face to the audience
absolutely i use the note to help me to mark important points and engage my teachers with eyetoeye in class
yes i am pleasantly suprised about amt program i love the programming coures here
but in everyday life i prefer to use chinese to talk with friends during the lecture
been energeticand curious about everything some virtues i missed for quite a long time arepretty common for the most of my classmates
but i think that low level of english listening and out of communication are very badi think some people in my groups are very nice they study hard and also like communicationg with others
someone are good at communication someone are good at create original ideas someone are able to execute practical matters
different talking style with people such as the difference of accent10
yes the induction course is very helpful
and i believe the spiderman said with great power comes great responsibility
that is not the case here4
and the assessment method is different
actuaaly we didnt know each other deeply so i can not judge themi think communication and negotiation are essential for successful collaborative learning
a group of people focused on the same problem open minded people good knowledge and learning resources the right amount of time common room for meetings not skype messenger etc
in the work of the group there will be times when the group members have different opinions
and i believe that we should find a right way to make our group united more and be more effective in our researches in the future
collaborative learning is all about students discussing and sharing their thoughts
there are many people on the road in china and in the school but there are many people who are much quieter on the campus in the uk8
for example i would keep recording what the lecturer said and as a result a lot of notes would be produced every day
the afternoon session have helped me get a feel for teamwork based project with a team of indivuduals who come from a wide mix of cultures
i think they can expand my thinking and inspire me a lot
combining our different experience and knowledge we can create quite interesting cooperations at the university as well as after classes
they would like to do the eye contact with us but they hardly have the interaction with us except the question part
i do aspire to be a distinction grade student my hesitation is preventing me from being a distinction grade student
the third thing is i couldn  t stick to my own opinion
when you try to understand others opinion you would find may be he would think lots of things which could change your mind
5 my university life in china is more boring than there is no extracurricular activity
i hope i could improve my oral english and get more confidence to speak english in public
yes i think the interaction here is more practical effective and international
the weird part is some times istill feel like been working rather than studying at school
thoroughlyprepared material word document or power point document can help you get a bettermutual understanding on the topic between you and your audience
just like tony taught us different jung typology styles have a different demand in a group
most of lecture delivered clearly and the slides are very clear
2in my undergraduate study i have to face a lot of exams and in york i need do many papers and reports instead of testsso what i used to do was memorise but now i need to learn how to look up information by myself and how to sort and use them
the blinder efforts will not only make me move forward but also let me back
8there are many kinds of activities in university of york to broaden myhorizons
6 the education of uk are more pay attention to team work
there were 72 students in my bachelor major each six people were allocated into one dormitory
so i spent an hour putting the things i wanted to buy into the shopping cart
i think the willingness of helping each other is essential for successful collaborative learning
i don  t want my tuition fee gone
and i think this may be the most important presentation during my college years
however there is no roll call system in college classes in europe and the united states5 testmost of the examination is a form is in the form of examination papers in the masters degree will generally increase the thesis part
during the study i could know the difference between our culture6
in class they always answer our questions efficiently and quickly which can solve our problems in most occasions
i know the library is a good place for learning and i will have ahigher learning efficiency in the library because the library has a lot ofuseful learning materials
forinstance health and safemanagement and marketing of technology is not totally new for me
the difficulty of communication in english will make my content unclear
most courses are very good especially the masterclass all aspects of it are the very clear and about signal learn lesson is complete from mathematical formula when it comes to how to convert between different signals but sensors amp instrumentation this course let me confused lecturers voice is not big enough when sit in little room also we heard in the classroom is not very clear the teacher looks not so good in his body most of the time i can only see the slides but slides did well so sometimes we cant hear what the teacher saying and guess what hes saying
when i read the first line i found that i did not know the words i would jump over to continue to read but if the particularly unfortunate each line has the words do not know i would be particularly helpless
i will learn as i can go in this year of our group
i think give content at first of the class is a good logic for us
as i expected
we built the paper tower
actually high quality in teaching means that e could gain better skills for students which is helpful for their work in the future
the biggest part of me preventing me from being a distinction grade student is my laziness
only by fully understanding and trusting each other can we put ourselves in the perspective of others in the task of accomplishing others rather than generate more suspicion and distrust
that two months that ive been living in york have passed very quickly but im feeling good with the course and the experience of living here
this led me to not use it well to recall the entire big knowledge point
the role of a tutor varies greatly
additionally most of the teacher donnot have the accent which i can totally understand them
the challenge is leadership and communication
3 the system of british education attach importance to reference
noi havent been involved in actual work so far so i havent done anything that are contrary to the rae ethical principles
respect with each otherand avoid fighting and quarreling
i like bidyuts lessons for the reason that he not only put the main points on the courseware but also explained them reasonably and explained them further with examples
this can help students quickly to know the whole contents of this class
when it refers to my academic writing i find that i am not good at making decision to choose which aspect of my topic i need to research or sometimes i make poor choices
for exampleprocess map however i did not attend marketing of technology before
i am glad to use collaborative learning in the future work because one plus one greater than two
students in my class tends to relate mostly well with themselves same nationality2
njs slides are informative but basically are easy to understand
i think i can find the results easily when i am looking for some notes from the specific subjects
yes of course
study hard no plagiarism no cheating
this is related to my last answer
york university gives me a lot of free timeto do improve myself like musical instruments and balls
plusi am going to respect the information of intellectual property toosecond in my future jobs i am going to work as an engineeringmanagerprojects
maybe i have taken some actions unexpectedly and i am so sorry i have no memory about them
for example they can help me in technical problems and i can help the others in accounting or marketing problemsas for the important factors for the teamwork maybe the most difficult thing is the cooperate
there are some discussions between teachers and students
i am really thankful
when i took internship in a real estate company my leader ask me to learn a new software so as to improve my professional skill but i didnt follow her advice because i think i have too many more important works to dobut now i realize that i should learn new professional knowledge and skills
to be honest i need to improve the accuracy and rigour in work and study
some of the lecturers use notes but just as a support material and they look at the very few timesmost of our lectures are in genesys 6 class so we dont have any problems to listen to the lecturer since the class is very little
i think several people around me are not very willing to learn they may have a rich family so they are not thirsty for success
i think i need to do a few things：listen
this is the most fundamental source of disagreement in teamwork
meanwhile some other students dont listen to teachers but take notes from slides continuously
even the software that is used frequently there are many modules that we have not noticed
some people are creative some have executive power and their performance is outstanding
compared with my first degree of applied physics and the msc in em here there are some differences1the theory of engineering management course can be used in real life
everything is useful for myself
speaker need to introduce their idea clearly in the limit time thus they usually have to describe key points of ideas in simple
not only confused about the life but also confused about the study
in my enterprise group project i try to find some research
especially when there are a lot of homework there will be inertia to avoid and i can  t arrange the time
the factors that i feel should be taken into account for collaborative learning 1
however in york we have to follow every regulation and rules of harvard reference because this can directly affect our results of reports3
firstlyi think i will develop myself to be more valuablesecondly i will devote more to assignments proactivelythirdly i will be more generous when facing something which make me feel uncomfortablefinally i will express my opinions if im angry rather than keep silence
but now we all take classes in the form of lectures
because they can offer many very interesting activities
as a manager i will take all my resposibility to obey the laws and principles
when i am listening i can use the mindmapping method to help me memorize the words
we will struggle to finish the group assignment if we insist on our own idea
so i am really positive in his classesbidyut is the first lecturer who i can understand well in classes because of his logical thinking
in other words testing is only a small aspect andpeople are going to progress and can not limited to a small test
seventh life in york is not as colorful as before
if we dont pay attention to communication skills and dont know to think about the problem from the perspective of others in the process of collaborative learning it will easily lead to failure
since there are teammembers who do not participate in the activities students need to influencethe overall situation with their own ability
living environment
in uk as my master degree different course information can use in one course
no i cant
working on the project would give us an insight about how we are going forward as a group
be lazy and wait too long to study
i can find that every part content flow logicallyit en ables me to think clearly about each knowledge module and i can easily find the connection between each partbsidessome teachers can liven up the classroom atmosphere by telling jokes
i am not sure which modules are referred
i still want to learn more if i have studied each course
however i have since overcome the unpleasant occurrences
the contents of the next lecture are also mentioned at the conclusion of the previous lecture
secondly reasonable work allocation is also vial for successful collaborative learning
however when others were giving suggestions i ignored some part of their speech and made inefficient communication with them finally the total brainstorming process was delayed
the rest need to be selfrestrained according to the specific industry they are engaged in but the moral principle is that as an engineer or businessman they need to abide by the basic requirements consciously
chinas education style are conservative so i am very eager for the way of education in the uk
now in the class i need to take the presentations very frequently but i just listened to my lectures in most time before10
the teachers in china pay more attention to the process of teaching while the teachers in the uk pay more attention to let the students themselves actively understand and discover
for instance some students do not have as much experience with programming as others so they have had to work harder to catch up in the modules involving coding
now its very important to look for problems and find them
however i havemore time to take notes when i read my course texts
there are some questions that will help you in class
in this way i can get a success in my presentation
i think i am not good at taking notes inclass and from the course texts
the team work is most help that can help our know each other fastly
im going to put some examples for some of the principles applied to my casefor the first principle i would say that the entire group has to be reliable and trust on each other so we can work as a team and not as individualsfor the second principle i would say that every time we make a decision on a group project it has to be justified as well as respect other peoples information any time we have to use itfor the third principle i would say that every change we will make in a project we have to know the reasons and be conscious of what we are doing
it is useful and convenient for reviewing
my supervision group is filled with a variety of students who have all the elements that are needed to be a successful engineering manger
maybe i think its easier to understand but its not easy for others actually
most of the students native language is not english
the teaching style is what i expected
about poor choices i am a little confused about the future career and so i do not what skill and knowlege i should prepare except the class content
it will be difficult to understand some complexities during class
chinese university study is mainly based on making questions and exams
in order to me as an individual to help counteract such a challenge i would have to accommodate the team members who hail from different cultures and help them understand my language and be more clear and slow when it comes to explaining key details of group work in my language english
therefore we have lectures in small classroom
the library is open 24 times
i only know that there are different cultures and every culture are very good
firstly i think the most basic thing is to keep myself relaxed and don  t be nervous
indeed i am happy with the induction
most of them fit my expectationi think our class have too much chinese people
this led to my omission of important information
i found that the way of thinking is different
besides it is a good idea to write a conclusion and thoughts for the finished class
no more help in essay7
2using theory is more flexible it may have different results when using the same theory in different case study3
although i felt that i would not use a handwritten notebook i was confused about the students who were writing carefully in class but only from my point of view i thought electronic notes were more efficient
i deem that working with group efficientlyeveryone did their own assignment on time and share feedback each other and having active discussion with members will foster success
international business the lecturer used a lot of background knowledge and extracurricular stories to help us understand the coursemanagement and marketing of technology the two lecturers are different in style but all are very academic and rigorouslaw for engineering management every lecturer has deep insights in his field and has a wealth of background knowledgemsc personal effectiveness and masterclasses each class lecturer leads us to understand different topics which makes us more professionalstrategy management for em use case studies to help us understand the corporate strategy
we do have some questions about the details the details are pretty troublesome
in the power point tutors alway put the key point which related to the main topic in the international business class john alway give our topic talk in the word document then we talk about this topic in the class
yes or even better
different major
i can discuss some topics of assignments and exchange opinions in the group
it was one of the main reasons why i chose the university of york
however due to the lack of detailedplan i can not enrich my life in a balanced way
for example we have an academic work about enterprise
the slides and the eyetoeye connection is pretty well
yes because now i dont know what should i do to preper my future study if i wan na to study phd
from their lectures i learned some skiss to get attention from others
second looking for evidence to support your opinion
id rather go though myself than talk to my friends about my predicament
if we have some questions we can ask teacher after class
the teacher imbue us with what he says directly and the questions they ask are of the standard type
i never sat in a lecture which was totally in english
i aspire to be a distinction grade student and i think everyone does as well
in this semester we have a total of seven courses among which personal efficiency is a skill course with emphasis on operability
yes i knew teachers in the uk have more interaction with students during the class before i have this class its ture just like i hearded
sometimes its tooaddicted to the plot of a game and forget to review the contents of the daysstudy
even if you do not well in your presentation content you can attract audience by your confidence
compared with what i experienced in undergraduate course modules are well organised and the objectives are very clear
yes we can contact with teacher by emails
because theres no teacher or family to remind you every day of what you need to learn
most of the lectures in these weeks are about an hour
actually taking notes like these are not useful for review before tests
for example some interestingpictures and video are very attractive
some students make a lot of preparations for the group assignment and put forward very advisable opinions for the group
i think i am a person who is more susceptible to the environment
if team member did not communicate timely conflicts can be easily emerged inside the team
but everything will pass and as time goes by people will eventually walk out of the past
i considered that ive become more open minded since i had to work with people from different countries
second the time management is also important because only with sufficient time can we access more valuable information and continually modify it if the schedule is unreasonable it is likely affect the finally failure to complete the task
actuallythe programme is really different from what i learn beforeand i did have a pleasantly surprise about the group work during the class
there are some ways forme to prove my english
in the course of engineering law we first studied the british legal system including civil law and criminal law
im pretty used to living and studying at york at this point
we want affirmationwe can do betteri think the biggest obstacle is the language problemi need to spend a lot of time and energy in understanding the content so that i can not only quickly grasp the key points but also further studysometimes the lecturer said something funny and everyone laughed
in the class of international business dr john made an activity to let us understand about hofsteder culture module
i am extaverted intuitive feeling and judgingit implicates that i am a good listener and diplomat which play roles in communication and negotiation at the same time i am extraordinarily careful that i must finish a programme instead of trust anyone else
i think the collaborative learning is very important for me in the furture
i havent properly tested myself yet but will come up with about 5 questions from each lecture and formulate a test to complete
there is another point i want to say the responsibility i cant use the english word to explain how important it is
i cant study efficiently on friday and saturday so all tasks are concentrated on sunday which will reduce the degree of completion of the original task
i think york is a great place to live in as well as to study
6the uk curriculum is more suitable for future job skills
we should always work together to make sure that all of us can use our own strengths to make our teamwork perfect and achieve everyones goal
secondly the content of the teachers lecture is also a way to help us enrich our knowledge and improve our professional skills
because of this i especially chose to attend a presessional programme at first
most of the research or background knowledge that lecturers talk about comes from books and they also give sources or bibliographies of their content
lecturerpositive reply to my question such as change the example to explain
i just did a good choice
language must be the first challenge for our team
now i have a general understanding
for example on strategy class the tutor let us built a system to recycle water in the home
he always pay full attention on what teacher said and come up with his own critical ideas during the group discussion
yesi think so
so i just want to try my best regardless of the results
as a leader i am aware of the importance of leadership and i should make many decisions which help group to realise the direction of work7
because i think collaborative learning can help me solve the problems better than i work alone
each of us has our own thoughts and we have different understandings of a certain knowledge
time schedule everyone has different business someone likes to talk face to face some people like online discussion
i think drjohn did very good in answer questionsbecause he always gave some examples
i am totally loving the way they go about teaching the curriculum
thirdly sometimes im not very familiar with the process of my homework
i think their answers are not very clear may be the reason is that it can not be prepared previously
if i didnt sleep at 1130 in the evening i would have been dozing off
we should take necessary notes of some theory and any important information
i think the most essential thing is that we need similar goals for the programme so that we can make effort together
i have some differences about listening maybe i havent adapt the english but i will try my best to adapt everything
the most important problem is that googles education service is available in european and american countries while china has stopped the service authority of google which is undoubtedly disastrous for the sharing and use of education resources
i think there has to be a leader in the team
compared with china the class in university of york is more active and we can communicate with teacher directly during the class time
yesi think soi am really convinced that i could learn multipleskills in the engineering management in york
i really feel that the pressure of study is not small and there are many things to do in homework or class exercise like presentation in international business model
i tell myself that i have to finish every assignment on time and leave some time for the modification
you should make specific notes about what you have seen in the following 5 areasscope and specification of the lecture – how well do you think the lecturer defined what it is they were going to talk about
sometimes even surpass the importance of learning and forget the initial intention of studying abroad
because i use ipad to take notes so i can not onlytake notes but also record the lecture so that when i review the notes it alsocan show me what lecturer said when i took this note
besides if i did not go to the sport center icould saved around 300 pounds
i think its time for me to put this plan into practicethe order of completion
you could also usefully take a look at the public speaking section for help in preparing for your first talkactivityarrange a onetoone meeting with your supervisor to discuss your progress so far this term and your reflections
however there are also some behaviours that will hinder success including being absent from the course and doing something unrelated during the course
i saw that each lecturer has a very clear structure of their speech
we often need to have presentations in public while i almost have never done it before7
i have to say all of my team members are excellent and it is my honour to be in a team with them
i can do some summaries when i am reading some models
for example during the collaboration process somemembers do not accept the advice from others which results team work cannotcontinue
some students are very active in class and they also have lots of novel ideas which really surprise me
class discussion
i should keep standard when i am writing reports or essays as well as pay attention to the formatalso i should think more，brainstorming is no less abundant
it is true that the academic work might become very boring and difficult but everyone should know the importance about academic honest
i think i can work to these principles during my msc timebut it will be difficult in my working timeonce a team or a company don not want to follow this principles for some benefits or some reasons it is difficult for individual to keep their mindssometimes the individual can not change others mindsand sometimes maybe he or she will take a risk of losing jobs
if it is the complex or long knowledge background the teacher will tell us in advance on vle to preparein the international business class teachers will use exaggerated body language rich facial expressions and changeable tone to help us better understand the background of the class content
i need to include both the theoretical knowledge and social culture in my graduate study plan
itcan help me save many money because i often go here and back 9
last week i didnt know anything about the future
i dont how to do it how to express our topic clearly how to attract others attention and finally get the approval of others
because it is not the course with typical form i hope i can do it well
there are differences in the pursuit of goals
the playin those days led to a serious decline in my test scores
i think everyone should find them rather than feeling good about ourselves
for example people in uk pay less attention to lunch if they have some work to do
understand each others abilities and do not be afraid of asking for helpabout understand each others abilities assign appropriate work and responsibilities after understanding each others goals and directions based on each persons different abilities and learning intentions
some of the group members may be tooconfident about hisher own opinions and unwilling to accept others  opinions4
i separate our team into different group to get the high efficiency in our programme
finish your own job and communication are the two main point for successful collaborative learning
since it has been 4 weeks i see a lot of good changes happening within my class group
therefore sometimes when iwas in the morning lecture i couldnt concentrate completely and even fellasleep so i couldnt absorb the knowledge taught by the lecturer to themaximum extent
drjohn always has a word document to show us the key points of his lectureit is very clear and to know next point
because many of them are studying abroad for the first time this is also a very common problemi think they can use the rich work experience and knowledge background to coordinate and distribute good work in the group as well as the control of the timeline
although i didnt understand why it was funny i thought it was funny so i laughed with everyonei remembered one timea lecturers asked me many times which country are you talking abouti didnt think about it until laterthis was a very easy questionbut i can not understand iti felt a little sillythe second problem is that i am a shy person and i am a little afraid of communicating with teachers and classmatesi should be more eager to communicate with others because everyones ideas are different from which i can learn a lot of new ideasanother disadvantage of mine is that i am a procrastinator and i need to sleep for a long timespecially in winter
first everyone share stances which could help groupmates acquire more knowledge
what surprised me most was that the students took notes very seriously
so i guess she is really successfulas for me i usually look through the slide by tutors in advance because i will have a better understand during our class and i think it is dramatically significant for my successful study
i am working hard to be a good student i will adapt to the english language environment as soon as possible and improve my english ability do everything i can best in the best school
as a engineering management i think the most difficult challenge is keeping the knowledge and skills up to date
undergraduate teachers will urge me to complete some content
furthermore having eye contact and interactions with audiences also play an important role
thusi expected that i could integrate into my class quickly and be active in class and be brave to communicate with teachers and classmates
after meeting with my supervision group i was pleasantly surprised by the mix of culturesbackground yet share the came culture with one of the students in my group
opportunity to know different culture
therefore these are the things which surprised me a lot
for example using teamwork in a speech will give everyone a chance to show themselves which will increase their confidence
yes some of courses are out of my prediction such as sensor and instrument and also intro to communication it mentioned how to trans signals between different power
i felt happy during the induction programme
this years professional for the format of the operation and reference and so on have these bright and strict requirements let me genuinely feel the rigour of british education7 the arrangement after class is not the same
i found the second session about the english language unnecessary but i obviously understand its importance as the majority of the students are international having very different backgrounds
interactivity and negotiation are essential in group learning and you may want to set up group interaction rules for young students
this will make the notes more memorable30 suggestion for methese are useful for example foridentifying all the tasks that have to be undertaken on a particular daynoting the key themes in a book or lecturenumbering key pointsbeing able to see what you need to do or remember very easilyidentifying resources to follow upkeep a record of resources such as useful webpages
i have come to britain from many cultures and the new concept of education is something i have never been exposed to in china
we have many writing assignments while we just need to attend final examinations6
because peoples personalities are different when many introverts are together or many people with independent personalities are in a team they sometimes do not communicate which is very detrimental to cooperation and success
and at the lecture some foreign students they always present the different opinion which can broaden my horizons and make me have an ability to jump out of my comfort zoon my own culture so that i can critically review some common sense which i used to believe totally
as masters students we are expected a lot more to look into different resources online for different projects that we are working on and teaching itself does not cover everything that is needed to get a high grade into the assignments
i am fully prepared for the study plan before the start of school and my study plan is very mature because of the experience and lessons of last year
in the long term in order to complete the later projects smoothly we need more coordination in work team leaders and each team member need to join every activity and everyone should actively face these challengesin terms of the challenges specifically ithink our team has to go through different challenges like working together tofinish a report and whats going to consider the ability of different groupsto work
yes i like it
and i think there could have more group work
everyone has a different work ethic when it comes to working together
i only asked for few times when introduction of communication there were good responses and perfectly sovle the problem if can provide more information about the process of each pracitcing and note will be better to me
besides i found that every lecturer is confident when they present i need to do more practices to enhance my confidence
compared to the first few weeks in october my ability of taking notes and organizing notes has improved significantly
i know this is a very bad study habit although it is very efficient but it is not conducive to the quality of homework
after three different lecturer introducing the law in the uk for us there were two lawyer coming from off campus in week4 and week5 one introduced what happens when things go wrong the other introduced employment law
the most important thing is there are some activities which help me familiar with my team member and know everyones advantage and shortcome
team members need to have common goals and interestshold back enough strength to point to which dozen which so the centripetal force of team member is very important team member is not much depend on essencein my opinion good teamwork requires team members to have the following three abilities the first is learning ability
based on the understanding of each other we can cooperate with each other perfectlyadditionally the leader can be really important for a whole team
now it is basically the rhythm of life of lectures libraries and homes but it also makes life more fulfilling9
it is a good way to help me to manage my time and plan
therefore i think language will be a big challenge for my essay in the future
sometimes i would have something that i really could not understand i would record them and find more information about them later
ive tried some way of taking notes
i think most of the slides are clear exceptthe last slides in this week  s marketing of technology class
however i was very enjoy when i work with my team members although we are not the won the first
from time to time teacher had some interaction with us which let the environment of class really relax
actually this is a meaningful question
work perfunctory
but sometimes it is a bit difficult for me to understand some notes with poor handwriting
in addition i can hear the lecture and see the slides clearly
i find thisvery interesting since management is always around us not only for workprocesses but also for every day decisions
studying is my current job so i really aspire to be a distinction grade student
it can be seen from the slides that all the slide is prepared well
every lecture is very logical and professor always talk some interesting thing or joke to attract our attention especially professor of marketing
enterprise course is not novelty to me
and i will miss a lot of important information and miss some key suggestions and methods
finally the group should discuss regularly and regularly and set a timetable to urge each team member to complete the task
i think the lecturers are welcomed us to ask questions and they will do their best to answer usi could understand after they answered
in my opinion the behaviours that can foster success are communication cooperation innovation optimism having the sense of responsibility curiosity and so on
thats humor
in some difficult knowledge points the lecturer will use case analysis or background culture to explain abstract information
there also have a lot ofthings that i need to improve
intercultural communication and the industrial revolution 40 are relevant and useful when studying international business and other classes
it can be used in both academic writing and teaching
sometimes i write concepts that i want to refresh at home because they are complex or because i need to practice it for myself i write recommended webs or books and other things that dont are in the slides
sometimes the topic is complex so they need more time to investigate and discuss
however now the profession more needs the actual work experience and the practised skill and so on8 the arrangement of classes is not the same
there were many lectures in my first degree and a little communication in class
of course i have done a lot of team work since the course start
after that i ranged my schedule and decided which part i coulddo in which time
at first i think the logic of the slides is essential the slides which produced by lecturers are very logical it helps us a lot to follow the lecturers idea
the lecturers will patiently explain to us the incomprehensible definitions or questions
well i think the rate of absent is slightly increased
i may learn from him
everyone in my group has different skills and someone always creates an innovative idea
the induction programme help we know each other
strictly speaking this difference is not very big it may just be the difference in the teachers teaching style
in addition he is extroverted and we all want to make friends with him
asking question is good way to learn more about thesubjectmost chinese studentslike to study hard during every day without rest
they tried to answer each students who asked question in detail
i also develop a self study timetable which must be strictly adhered to on module by module on daily and weekly basis
especially listening
i can help them in return in the same way
yes its quite different from what i have experienced in the past yeari feel happy with my programme it makes us thinking actively and we know each other well after the induction programme
the speaker performance is very nicei can hear the lecturer clearlybut i think the sildes can add more information about the course content because some student they can review by the slides
i can understand my notes after the lecture as its colour coded so i know which point correlates to what slide
the lectures were really well delivered and the presentations were good maybe one thing that i would improve would be the number of presentations from the students by making more of then even though this is just the beginning
as we all know poor physical condition will affect our effectiveness badly so i need to take care of my safe and healthy
all of them speak loudly and clearly during the class as well as they always have a look of eye contact
third sometimes you will encounter some meanings that are too simple to know that the problem exists
after finishing this lecture we will look through a lot of books to satisfy our cruiosity which is helpful to broden our horizon
however i have to admit it is so hard and tense to keep pace with the general progress
for some students they didnt come to class on time they were late and absent but there were very few of them
actually i am really interested in these teaching style in the university of york because most of courses were interesting and activityfor instance during international business john always gives us different interesting activities including program presentation he usually plan his course according to small things in our life and then sensitive our brainstorm we can not only gain knowledge but also improve teamwork and critical thinkingin my view most lectures plan their topics according to module requirements and reflection from students
but i know i have some badhabits would discourage me to be a grade studentthe first thing is procrastination
there are many assignments need to be worked by group
i believe i can work these principles into both my msc studies and working life by starting to implement them into modules such as enterprise currently and next year during the research group project that will commence in summer term
bidyut baruah listened to my presentation during the presessional english language course and he recognized me in this induction
for example focus on the key content of the class teacherthe organization of my notes1
however we came to the uk and i hope that i can use english more skillfully
actually i don  t think i have the ambition to get a distinguish grade what i want to do is do my job and just do it
when we have problems they are willing to help us and teach us how to solve the problem
sometimes it is difficult to understand the meaning of the teacher it is difficult to communicate with people whose native language is english
i am poor at language and i find the reason why i could not understand the lecture content totally in class is the vocabulary problem
in the process of class we strive to absorb knowledge
i believe that we can achieve a good interaction
the teacher will introduce more content in each lesson and there will be a lot of notes
more group project5
the sessions not only helped me about the school rulesbut also create a great chance for me to make more friendsthe group activity was amazing and most helpful the teacher asked us to combined pictures to create a new objectthe relationship between the group members became betterand the friend circle was quickly established
of course every student want to be a distinction grade student
in every lecture lecturer focus on a topic or a main point
complete the study plan contains a lot of content including different peoples help it can be from the resources of the school students share or online case but the problem is also many such as most of our school team are using the english text but before my degree of access to the programming of the text is chinese explanation this requires that i spend a lot of time to understand each other and use between the two although will cost a lot of time but some students help and explain can solve all these problems some strange questions such as pcb tools before i dont know what is completelyi will not be mentioned during my oneyear study in the uk
it really helps me follow him as well move from one point to the next
it is another thing to do
it is a bad habit i need to eliminate for my goal
this process can make us assess ourselves better
furthermore the procession of the lecture should be logical
some of the background knowledge come from the book some are from the news or internet others are from the previous research
comparingchinese lecturer our course lecture are more friendly and more activity there are a good communication atmosphere4
im not agree with the result of the test because i think i also can provide many ideas when we meet problems and i think i can encourage my teammates when they needi think different characters in a team can lead to a good result because they can make up the difference between each other
before every lecture the professor told us the main task this lecture which really could help us to better understand the content in the next step
but now our communication is a little difficult
before i attend the presessional program here i used to take notes by writing down what the teacher said and listing them one of the changes i have made in the method of note taking is that l have known how to do the mind mapping for the course texts which makes my notes more clear and easier to memory
we could analyse the topic to find some keywords and we can design our lecture with what why how about the topic
1some ideas are not goodthe team misjudgment
howeverweakness in his lecture was the class was very bigbidyutbaruah defines his lecture clearly
exercise time i seldom set up my own exercise before
first when istarted my classes i wrote down everything because i thought that it importantthen i learned another technique which consist in graphic
well we all know that every country has their own laws and they work differently in many cases thats probably due to the different cultures so i expecting to be even more openminded and accept other peoples ideas that come from a different point of view or country
workshops and labs im up to date with the labs work which isnt punctuable for the assignment and last week we had to do a formative assessment which im quite happy with the result next friday well talk about it with frank
he can not make a choice by himself he needs to convince and persuade everyone why you choose this
i have used the ebay website to sell my secondhand items
the marketing lecturer has different way to design his sessions which always gave us some real model to analyze like some famous brands and firm
the first is the number of years of study the uk is 1 year and our country is 24 years
to be honest the academic work is challenging for me because its not my major in college
what i expect are that everyone in the class could carefully listen to the class and do their best to controbute the teamwork
just like law for em it is hard for me to keep pace with the lecture because there are too many new words and too much knowledge
that does reduce my burden of final examtenthly in order to ensure the attendance in china we should answer the questions in turn with the record from teacher
so whether you  re in a lecture or chatting to friends in a café you  ll be advancing your language skills every day in the home of the english language6critical thinkingmost importantly all the innovative teaching methods on offer will support your ability to think critically an essential skill in your studies and for your future employability
i am so lucky that everyone in my team are have a high sense of duty for finished the work we need do together
i do think that the course will be what i expected in terms of content depth of learning and work load
in my opinion the most important factor for successful collaborative learning is thirst of knowledge
for collaborative learning i think that in addition to our existing group is a form of education our communication with teachers is also a form of collaborative learning
the teacher lectures in different ways such as using ppt to show the key points6
i expect to have more group talk with difference classmates in the class rather than just supervision group
there was a lot of interaction and positive feedback from students
in a group work can not continue the discussion without well prepared
they speak clearly and most of them have nice powerpoint
as the result of this bad behavior i waste a lot of time，which leads to i do not have enough time to improve my work
i always review my note in the class and slides
international business uses a mix of powerpoint and word the former being a great way to present lecture material but the latter is hard to read and mainly serve the lecturer as opposed to the studentsall the lecturers maintain good eye contact with the students when they teach a lecture good meaning they help include everyone in the lecture and this helps the students to engage especially when a student asks a question directly to the lecturer
all other students in my supervision group have different strengths
although there are similar meetings in china they are not as lively and exciting as they used to be
as for me i really want to become adistinction grade student which i think it can be great honor in mypostgraduate studyi will take the life and study of graduate studentsseriously
now i have to preview what i want to learn in order to give a better lecture6
however the 2 or 3 credits approach is not as bad as it might seem since now i realize that i have an idea of almost all the concepts that have been given here and now i can go much in depth with them much easier than if they were completely newand last but not least when i was living in barcelona i had a lot more distractions than here since i was singing in a couple of choirs conducting another one working parttime and especially the weekends and much much more activities that stole my time
the order of these contents depends on the right order of a pptafter speaking something about content he teaches ussomething about the body language movement wearing voice and so on
but there are some tips preventing me from being a distinction grade student
yes i can
i feel that when i set a timetable i couldslow down my procrastination very well
under such a test the individuals academic ability will bepositively improvedfor major differences regarding my firstdegree and current education this can be said to be autonomous learning
first i hope that the teacher will avoid asking do you understand or i understand if i understand when the class is being lectured because most students will face it in person
high academic standard9
i was surprised at how new the course is
i can then possibly share these tests with my coursemates
the level of interaction is much higher than what i have experienced in the past
he patiently told me about their differencesnj when i listened to other peoples questions professor nj reacted very quickly and seems like that there would be no problem that would stump himtw would encourage students to ask questions and answers are easy to understandji is very very patient and will encourage students to go through even they are not fluently in speaking englishjn listens very clearly and answers clearly
i have been studying for two months at the universityof york
sometimes the teacher will use the form of video to understand more quickly and intuitively
he has the ability to attract students attention
first of all the leader of our group thomas who led us to complete the group work was very orderly
so far all the lecturers seem to be very prepared and competent in the fieldof the lecturethe questions are correctly addressed the topics fully covered and theexperience is palpablethis is one important thing having the experience in the field and share itwith us
all in all i think i should to be more positive and decisive
i have been very good since i arrived in york in september
every student and teachers are very friendly with each other i am very happy to communicate with everyone
secondly for the article the link to the document or the name of the book are attached
recording the lecturers content in chinese was always not clear enough for reviewing the key points while taking notes in english is difficult for keeping up with the lecture
theories and keywords start to make sense after the lecture
i can help the team better achieve the goal through some creativity and the ability to quickly find resources
3 chinese university teachers will speak a lot of topics in class and they rarely use computers to teach they are mainly based on book knowledge
in other words he is older and more experienced than most of students
this will make our ideas about the problem more unified and communication is relatively easy
sometimes the clear answer could help me to know the real meaning of the knowledge
the campus offers a lot of social spaces for everyone to interact with each other to promote internationalization
the core competence of a team is not only a simple accumulation of one  s core competence
for example the communication between group member is a vital factor
exactly
he said that i cant have procrastination anymore，i had to change this bad habit
as a result there are often differences of opinion within the team and all team members can not participate in the task
i saw that heremost people give their opinion about the topic in order to fix the problemfurther some culture like south america where some people like to speak mostof the time
as i stated previously the method that really works for me is to first understand what is the current topic about and once that i fully understand it then i rewrite it but using my own style having special emphasis in those little things that moves everything
after all what better way is there to become a leader in your field than being taught by one
through this activity i learned the ideas of different members of the group and i also know how to respect others opinions and learn the importance of listening
every lesson in the uk is more shorter than in china
i think all lectures are delivered very well
since each lecturer comes from a different country and a different culture which gives them different humor styles some lecturers like to share interesting stories during the presentation and some lecturers prefer to use funny pictures on their slides
however i am studying hard in order to have good base soi can understand clearly professor and i could ask some questions
if any issues are raised the teachers will give definite answers
no i am mightily pleased about the program structure especially some of the modules
the lecture is good
chinese students are not very involved in the teachers question
as expected student seem fairly engaged with the material being delivered during lectures
because the attitude decides everything and itis the first step to succeed
it is quite different between the first degree and msc in emin the following1
helping with others if anymember in our group is in trouble
i can see the book which recommended by tutor and i can read the learning material before class and some lectures have the video then i can watching it again to get a deep understand
besides never be afraid to say out your idea even though it is the opposite of your group members ideas
first of all let me have a general understanding of my graduate study and life
actually i pay more attention on the teacher rather than the students
we can talk with different students in my supervision group some people learned electronic some people learned structure
another important point is our teacher will repeat those questions before answering them
it seems that there is one person who drags me behind but i know this person names lazy and procrastination
however if i got a role that i never played before it is ok for me as well because i have a new opportunity to improve myself
also i can feel they have confidencei can remember in the law module b
secondly in formal lectures the connection and logic of knowledge is also very obvious and he often mentioned humorous example
professors said we should combine study with playnever studying all the time and never playing instead of learningthe activity of building is a good way to improve the ability of team work spirit and problemsolving ability
for example in this week  s msc personal effectiveness and master classesdr bidyut baruah teachus something about how to attractive the audience in the presentation
i havent asked the lecturers any questions yetbut i found that they usually can answer other students  questions clearly inthe class
but what if i dont want to do the ethics choice i might lose my job so its very hard to give my words now
there is only one lecture for us em students
especially in my group they are all intelligent and friendly everyone is happy to share resources
have confidence in yourself and group members3
when noticing my course mates it is very interesting how every single one comes from a different background
i will list them one by one 1
i understand that english speaking skills here in group work is most significant because the more clear i describe the more possibility i have to become a team leader
try to learn from others
my goal also includes to be recognized as anoutstanding student with a distinction
because there is some boundary to what you learn at school and it will give you enough time to study
if there is something i need i will simply write it down on the app of my mobile phonein the process of discussion questions taking notes is very be necessary at that time i tend to put all the content of the need to type in the memorandum of mobile phone or a mass in the mailbox because the software has a search engine when i want to go to find i will enter the keyword query rather than one note it can save a lot of timeof course i also use some simple symbols or special tags spaces and new paragraphs to prioritize my content so that i can remind myself when i view it
if the collaborative learning is unsuccessful it probably because someone did not pay attention on what he or she should do
it is quite different with the lecture in york
as we all know a word may have so many differentmeanings and that may confuse us
hard to say at this moment because as atm we had only one introduction ios programming lecture
i think the level of interaction within my expectations
but it seeemed not to change my learning or thinkings
i think that will be a change in china even the world to provide more opportunity for the female to achieve their big goals in life4th chinese is a mysterious language its difficult to understand what the chinese character really means about in different sentences even the only one word have the different meaning with the tone voice
i am that kind of person that never talk big and i am not sure is that because lacking of confidence
some information is very important for me
however sometimes this is not a bad mentality
although i can see why it may be beneficial to international students
i think there are some differences between my last formal education and the msc in em here at york1
in the uk one semester is only half of a semester in china
at the beginning they will have different ideas and suggestions on a topic which requires them to decide the final content through communication
i want to say that i really love this kind of living style
because we are all from china so we have same background
whats more there are several video resources or books recommended at the end of some lectures
because if you don  t communicate with others nobody knows what you are thinking about2
in terms of distinction this is the biggest affirmation for a student in the academic method so i am very eager to get this distinction
on the contrary i should join to some activities go to some job fairs and learn more about companies in different fields and in order to enrich my knowledge and broaden my horizons
learning without challenge lacks a lot of fun
firstly we have only been a group for more than 10 days and we dont know each other very well so we may have some things to decide slowly
i need to learn it because most of my score will be evaluatedreviewing reports
trust your group members2
at the same time to understand each other this will promote everyones feelings
besides before introducing a new topic we can see the structure of content in the introduction part
he also is engaged witheyestoeyes contact
glad to see that everyone is quite engaged both with the modules and their colleagues
if i do take notes they arent especially organized
and this class is really special as there are different professional lawyers teaching us in different areas of law
the learning environment is different and classes are shared with classmates and friends from all over the world2
and it is a huge change from my undergraduate major to engineering management
because this is the first time youve introduced the entire academic years teaching process before class
only modest talents can accept their own deficiencies and become betterfor me the most critical part of hindering success is playfulness and slackness
i dont think it is easy in studying life currently more reading more assignments group working also hard1
well i learnt some methods and abilities from collaborative learningfirstly unity is significant for a groups project
the biggest difference with china is that york university has no walls or gates
through full preparation i fully believe that what i said is correct
at the same time the lecturers will also display background knowledge in the form of videos or photos
it seems a niggling but searching again and again is quite inefficient especially when you have to find many sources
this week we had more and more opportunities to talk with new classmates and new teachers
when a student is lazy he can not getgood grades in his courses even get nopass grades
also there are currently complete education solutions similar to googles in china and baidu can only solve the problem of some academic materials
in the past two months i have learned alot of positive things as an international student
this will prevent them from learning from others
these contents will be of great help to the study of next class which will help us understand or extend more ideas in class
for example this is the first time i get along with people who from different culture this might have the culture shock
by and large their expressions are clear but sometimes i dont understand when they speak quickly and they all make eye contact
this profession will help me expand the width of my career choice in the future
different living environments4
actually i dont know even dont know am i going to use collaborative learning
then thiswas a serious problem each of us give some opinion about the issue
by the research on the internet that we can see china is one of the most safety countries around the world
i need to overcome my shyness and lackof selfconfidence to complete this part
i think the course material is very interesting
they used humor in the lecture
but maybe the modules will ask us to do iti think if i have a chance to collaborate with other people i will see the sechuale and set the goal for every meeting and ask everyone to follow and engage everyone to join into the team
with these three elements a talk success is possible
before the professional teachers and students are relatively few words may be engaged in the computer industry not very good at communicating with people
actually i absolutely understand my notes when i review them as they are what i wrote down with my understanding
if all the members only know the finical skills that wouldbe hard to do the other part of the whole mission
if you want to return to work in the future you should know more about chinas laws on engineering management as well as career development prospects and professional skills3
he has verypolite manner to call the attention to students when they are boring in hisclassprofessorjhoanna is excellent motivator
trying to listening other peoples opinion and use their opinions to improve my opinion rather than try to convince other people that their opinion is not good
em is the generalplanning of engineering projects
this would be the starting point of a future disaster
so the teamwork can be a voluntary cooperation to reach the established goal and collaborative efficiently
although sometimes it is a bit cumbersome in terms of workload the final product has a good effect
after all confidence is all there is
when a person can not express himself wellothers can not understand what he saidthe collaborative learning must be inefficient and unsuccessful
because every class has a slide or word document i rarely take notes
as a result of my personality i do not like to go out and meet more people and the lack of social contact is also a major problem
personally i appreciate this split because i remember that when i was studying my bachelor i had duplicatelessons in various subjects and i felt it as a waste of timeabout the single lecture design normally they are well designed and even the two hours long lessons are agile
however during the lecture all the lecturer give a lecture neither too slow nor too fast
like watching movies listening to music wasting time onsocial media talking with friends etc… i really know that all these are excusesthat stops me in doing what i really need to do
according to the rae ethical principles there are 4 principles honesty and integrity respect for life law the environment and public good accuracy and rigour and leadership and communication
i think the communication is a factor to foster success and simply introduce your things is not good
thereis no team work in my major and there is no discussion part
no copy
surprisingly most of these students are the foreigners not the chinese
i thought my classmates and i can work as a team and we find and solve problems together
i remember a guy from peru in my class who is much elder than me told me that he comes here for his dream
learning skills can improve the efficiency of learning but sometimes i cant figure out some of my learning tasks such as taking notes and not finding the key points which leads me to be affected during selfstudy or review
and the plan is delay so serious and then nothing can help
however recently i think that summarise in my own words would be very useful when i review lectures because it saves a lot of time compared to reading all the slides and reading materials
studying in the uk can be seen as an exercise in my selfcare ability
their shares could help me during my study well this year in york it is lucky for me that i can attend this inductionhowever i hope i can attend some introduction about career and how to write cv in the next sessions if it is possible
absolutely good
and taking with team members when we have different opinions
the program is goodi think the program gives students more free time to arrangeby managing their time properlythe students can enjoying here more
2 show energy to learn the things you dont know
for the course of international business the lecturer is dr john
moreover i learned that the process of study not the way to receive knowledge，but the way to practice
although this is a bit exaggerated it is enough to reflect my fault
thinking like a teacher and try to indicate what l will test the students and then have an overall review
we agreed to play games for an hour but when the hour arrived we didnt enjoy ourselves
classes start earlier in china
for example elearning system surprised me and some personality tests included in elearning were useful for me to understand myself deeply
i rarely have teamwork or group discussions in my university studies in china
the other game called halo on xboxthe first day it display i bought it and played it for two days （only eat sleep andplay it）
to remind me review that again later
bidyut deals with my questions more efficiently compared with other teachers
foreign friends
some students have their own unique ideas
firstly duringthe class i cant understand the course content in a hundred percent sometimesi feel a little confused about some new word that i didn  t heard before and i didn  tfind answers from books or ask teachers or watch the repeat the lecture video afterclass what i do is just let it go it is obvious that i can not make progressfrom it
i used to think it only taught some basic skills butnow it teaches me how to reflect on life and the future which is a greatpromotion for the personal future
yes i found that the teacher has much interaction with us which makes me easy to understand the content of class
i cant think of any situations in which i have taken actions that are contrary to the rae ethical principles
for example weighing in the money and the law this may be a future challenge for me
compared with chinese schools york has different scoring rules and systems to judge whether a student is distinct
this is a good phenomenon
it hasnt changed anything so far just made me think more about what skill employers might want
especially in international business john could always give us some hilarious jokes to obtain our attentions for the topic
maybe the challenges are accuracy and rigor honesty and integrity listening and informing and to ensure that all work is lawful and justified
how do you treat it and what kind of feedback it will give you
because you will believe that your partner just has disagreements with this problem not with you
engineering management needs to have preliminaryscientific research and practical work ability
second understand the characteristics of each team member and arrange tasks according to his strengths and weaknesses
i started taking notes during the lectures since my midschool so it was then where i struggled to make proper notes as i was not able to match lecturers with my writing speed
some of our group member more prefer to stick to my point of view when we have different opinion we need to have more time to adjust each other
i will think about this place during class ishould go back and look at it but i will quickly forget it when i go back
it designed very well the class is fun and interesting
worst of all is when i want to be unnecessarily lazy when i ought to be up and running in the face of pending assignment
when i was young my dream was to be a scientist and an astronaut
in the strategy class the teacher guided us to learn this model based on amazons business model and development
first of all punctuality is a good character because it is respect for others time
however this behaviour has had a negative impact on meprocrastinationhinders my normal work so i need to treat it correctlyi hope that i can become a good student andi hope that i can get a distinction degree
preclass preparation helps to better understand new knowledge and afterclass review is for better digestion of knowledge learned
then there is the issue of personal socialization
in my group most of the members have moderate preference of feeling over thinkingso we always can come up our real feeling and opinions at the first time we face the problems
the group work called tower of york impressed me a lot i had lot of fun in this game and had deeper understanding with my team2
ihave made a commitment with myself to change my behaviors and thoughts tocomplete satisfactorily my tasks
for those who havegreat ambitions they usually pay attention to two key points
civil engineering has a lot of examinations but there are very less examinations7
i felt very happy that day because each of us showedtheir talents
i think that i canimprove them through practice more and more
frank is also friendly and explains thing well during the lectures
first of all the teachers are very friendly
when we discuss tasks and need to have idea sometimes i have many ideas but i can not decide which one is best and which one i should choose
i can take these principles and take this line
well every subject has given us prereading list or relevant case study and i read some documents before i started my coursefor example i had ever read leading across culture after lecture introduce the different cultures in international business
we can easily click the links and keep on learning more background knowledge or further points i personally appreciate this friendly way so much
the second one is the design of talksome lecturers give a talk designed in a humorous way and audiences will feel interestedlast but not leasti think some lecturers use signposting phrases during a talkwhich can help audiences more from one point to next
its the foundation of the team that every individual trusts and respects each other only then group members can work together and finish assignments successfullysecond effective communication is important in the process of team work
everyone has equal responsibilities and should make similar contributions in the group work，every team member should have equallearning opportunities
of course sometimes i do not have any ideas which is more maddening
i find that some students are very active in interacting with the lecturer which surprises me
sometimes lecturers made some activities with us and everyone can join in
this is the first time for me to study together with nochinese students and they really affect me a lotespecially during the discussion section in classcompared with chinesethe students with western culture background always show more positive in the class and engaged themselves totally in discussion sectioni think this is very important for me to learn from them and improve myself in class
even though weinsisted to stay on our original plan our customer decides to drop some standardit was an impossible mission to talk some sense to the customer withoutprofessional knowledge so we give in eventually
the knowledge given by teachers is more inclined to a framework which needs our own learning later
to make presentation flow more logically and consistently lecturers have to prepare speech draft previously
what we need to do is try to control ourselves and arrange a good timetable between learning and having fun
besides it would be wonderful for us to have a class organized by three teachers who stayed with us this week
after leaving my friendshouse at 6 oclock i start to finish the content of the elearning at thismoment
the academic work is not easy i must to work hard on iti am almost certain that all the classmates in the class are eager to be the best students in the class
not to pay attention to efficiency and communication in group cooperation is an important reason for failure
due to the fact that the distance is about 25 minute walk from myhome to the sport center i found it is too far
firstly msc studying is really different with my beng course
for example the lecturers will give a clear overview of what a specific lecture will cover
but in china teachers tell students what to do step by step and always supervise the content and time of homework5
after my last modification i used this for the first time which is very convenient
the teacher is very clear about the class but after the homework the teacher did not give feedback
the teachers in york is very willing to acceptour feedback and we can communicate with her timely through email7
that is so terrible for me
now i dont have to share the room with others it is a test of my personal subjective learningsecond the purpose of learning is different
i think the flow they used is very smooth they help us move from one to the next with expected and they all very humor the way they talk can draw our attention efficacious and they way they talk is very logical
and under the incomprehensible part of the line this is convenient for me to ask questions
as i said above if one group lacks trust and understanding it will cause more problems
this is what i expect
the teaching style that appeal me
like i said above totally independent here so have to do all the stuff by myself
i think their way of teaching is more attractive and more acceptable
i think that other students often have great ideas which is helpful to complete the program
i think the lecturer will prepare some relevantmaterials such as pictures or video in advance to help students understand
they arenot very easy to understand
i use connells note taking method
on the other hand it will also be useful in the future work as there are many works that need cooperation
the distribution of work is also important so that everyone can do what they are best at
hopefully things would head on the right coursemiao chen is still kind of lost i believe she could achieve something biggerin her life when she knows what she really wants
the teachers will ask questions at the end of the class
i like the first week very much because it gives me a certain understanding of the school the em and my future study and life
everyone has the ability of everyone and everyone has different problem insights
team members must work together activelyand enthusiastically to complete the tasks as planned and the goals must beconsistent so as to generate cohesion and achieve the goals effectively
i consider it is a great success that someone could fine or realize there are some bad habit on them
1 first and the most important the language is the biggest difference
there are some doubts in the design process
this will lead to unsatisfactory communication and inappropriate work arrangements
no matter in general typing or typing words for future reports and assessment high typing speed should be very helpful and i will spend more times to practice it
i have learned many lessons from the mistakes which has helped me a loti believe that if i work hard i will achieve my dream
as a results our strengths can be stronger than before and we can also make up our weaknesses
no i find quite comfortable and adapt to the programme fastly
i prefer to present an organizer in the future
in addition try to explain your point of view with critical thinking
when i was in primary school middle school and high school ialways was one of the distinction grade student
i think this course taught me teamwork and innovative thinking
a good leader can create a comfortable environment for members to finish collaborative learning successfully
yesi am worried about my writing skill
because sometimes people only care about themselves when collaborative learning
he also is responsible that everybodyparticipates in the group because there are sometimes people who do not like totalk
then they can be used to give a talk
definitely yes
i concerned about the courses flexibility the year ahead
when all the members regard each other as the rivals not the collaborators it would bring up to an extreme conflict finally
during my working time i abided by my bosss instructions even though there were some unreasonable demands which may cause some potential risks
i concern about whether i can improve my problem solving ability and promote my academic competence
team there used to be team tasks but not many
in my former study i have never been in something contrary to the rae ethical principles
i really like we study or work as a team it is a really good way to help us get familiar with each other
when i face some problems i am always used to preparing with the experience of others instead of trying to find a solution that suits me
i do not prefer taking notes in the notebook
sometimes i need really concentrate to listen to the lecturer and to figure out what he says
only when learning becomes your own thing instead of being a burden and burden can you truly step into learning discover the mystery of learning feel the fun of learning and learn into a virtuous circle
which leads to a problem that i can not use these sources at once while i need them
your time can be easily wasted in the mobile phone and you will lose a lot of contents from the lecturer
there is however the same expectation to undertake forty hours of study per week through a combination of any contact hours and personal studyanother major difference is that this msc is assessed entirely through coursework whereas during my undergraduate degree i was graded based on my performance in both coursework and exams
in the evening it took more than an hour to make a fine dinner
therefore in the next stage of learning we must firstly do a good job of time management
definitely i want to get a distinction degree
yes i got the straight answers for themost of times
therefore pessimism is also my motivationto draw a conclusion these are bad things which prevent me from being a distinction grade student
i think the trust is very important that you have to trust your team members in the work trust is the premise of cooperation
as far as i am concerned electronic devices are not allowed in chinese classes
bad communication process or skills can lead to a failure collaborative learning
to be honesti hope my group can deal with all the problemshoweverif we meet some challengesi will try my best to work with my group to overcome themalthough we might have different opinions when we work togetheri think i can stand in their shoes to understand their thoughtsjohns lecture about the different culture and the book written by hofstede help me to learn the other culture and analyse the culture by a scientific way
i almost never ask the teacher questions this is becausei am not sure whether my question is valuable
i think it may caused by the lecturers health
therefore i need to change this bad behaviour as soon as possible
this is not conducive to students free study
they have abilities to solve the realworld problem which i do not have
their passion actually affects me and i think it is the role we play for each other to help and encourage at any time
i can know where need improvement and which part i perform pretty wellall in all from my point of view the traditional chinese studying and teaching style are quite different from the uk
academic work is serious
theclassmates here are from all over the world
because i am not confidentand lazy i will avoid becoming a responsible person when the team has a taskas a qualified project manager you should have the courage to take risks
we need to discuss and communicate with him or herbesides we need to be dedicated dont care about how much work we have and we can actively listen to the opinions of other members
take international business as an example the lecturer referenced the lewis model to reveal the culture of mutiactive linearactive and reactive
in mycase i am a little not updated with it
we use a different way treating the assignments compare withcollege
in the past i only knew how to use directreference and make the reference directory3
second collaborative learning will fail for the reason that there is a lack of trust in the group
because it can make group members familiar with each other quickly
of course i will follow the principles
also they used notes to let the course logically
what is collaborative learning
for example when tutors arrange some homework for us i always put them aside at the first time until the deadline closed
the team not only focuses on the individual work more emphasis is put on the overall performance of the team
i think there is a lot of opportunity for us to help each other study goals as we have a wide range of experiences
however i could not touch so manyforeigners in my country not to mention talking to them9
i sometimes procrastinate work when i feel its too hard and need a lot of time to handle with
evidence is the most import part in the lecture it can supports your viewpoint and increase your credibility of ideas
maybe this is the cultural shock and i should accept the differences and change my mind since i have choosen to study abroad
i prefer to have note on my laptop
these days i reexplored my role in the team and learned how to make teamwork more efficientwhat excites me most is that our new team has built the tallest tower through efficient communication and reasonable division of labor within limited time and materials
in fact collaborative learning in my group went smoothly
we come from different country we have different culture we can have various opinion in a question
most chinese postgraduate study is three years but british postgraduate study is one year4
this will help me keep up with the teachers ideas and allow me more time to understand what he is saying
sometimes the lecturer may extend their topic by making some examples and listing some stats
if you look closely at the things above vle you will find that there are many things to do every day and most students are also very busy
when i hear the key content i will also focus on the course
i think it should be in the management department
yes i think so
some people tell me that it does not matter for being late such few minutes but i am still angry about myself for my lateness
i saw some students prepare notes in advance according to the power point contents before class
i was happy with the induction programme as well with the kind of attention they offered to all the students
but everyone is not easy to break their comfort zone
i still remember that in the first week of the lecture we had to finish the test on the vle and there are lots of concepts and definitions we need to remember about our academic works
yes i want to groom my self in respect of self confidence speaking fluent english i am willing to gain knowledge of creating new ideas improving decision making skills and by this program i can enhance my all skills level
even if i finish my studies next year and return to chinaagain i will never forget the memories of living here
this has not particularly surprised me as i was aware that the university accepts students with a diverse array of undergraduate degrees on to this course thanks to the entry requirements that have been published
this behaviour isnt going to help them at university
is quite different than my home university but i like the way the lectures are given
but no matter what i think logic is the most important thing in teaching process because it can help us absorb and understand new knowledge better with an important means of effective teaching
personallyi don  t like to go to the library
only one member of group is talking all the time
there will be a dilemma to choose between principles and the interest of the company
done that part
i am pleased to have a lot of timetabled contact time and the availability of staff that i used to at york
and differences are in the following aspects1 here needs more selflearning ability
absolutely the first one is that the learning environment all the resources and course contents are in english which is my second language2
i feel that increasing communication between teams and setting the same goals can effectively avoid problemsfor the international businesswe should take the initiative to adapt to the british culture such as actively participating in various activities making friends with local culture learning about it and learning from life to learning
the interaction with the teacher is what i am looking forward to
i think what i can do is communicating with both sides in order to achieve an agreement to keep the project carrying on
theres a lot to learn from the speakers ive heard before
encourage different ideas and critical thinking4
for examplein my group hao wang is very serious and jianan shi has many friend
in such a learning environment the atmosphere of class is no longer boring and the speeches of classmates and teachers in the class can make me think more and more
when reading i will carefully excerpt which will help me sort out the logic
the last thing is procrastination
in the process i believe that i will encounter many challenges
we have presentations here every week which can cultivate our confidence and selflearning ability
i put the most urgent and important thing first and the important but not urgent thing in the second place in other words i prioritize these over less important tasks
for example they will imitate others to explain to express the knowledge they want to convey to us which is very interesting and fascinating
i have some concerns about the year ahead
the similarities in personality will help us get along well with each other
the connections between knowledge points are very fluid and easy to understand
isearch for some books about writing skills from the library of our universityin conclusion although i have several bad habits ofstudents i want to change them in the next following year
just like the answer to the previous question in the international business class teachers will use exaggerated body language rich facial expressions and changeable tone to let us better understand the background of the class content
the most time spent every day is not the course the preparation or review but the thinking of what to eat every day where to buy things what to do during the holidays
when i was in junior high school i started to learn computer programming but it also let me ask a question that is how the computer works after i press the power button so i chose electronic engineering at the university
i must always ask myself to pursue innovation and always maintain a desire for knowledge
therefore making a longterm plan and shortterm plan is ofimportant to all students
for the possible test questions i will notice what the lectuer speaks in the lecture when they spend lots of time explaining what something means it must be a core point and to a large extent may be test questions
i think i must be able to keep these principles in my mind not only during the taught msc but also throughout my whole life
one surprise regarding induction week was how extensive the professional development framework pdf was as i had never had lectures of this range during induction week in past degrees
after that i will search these keywords on the internet to find some academic research which can support my point or help me to get more information about my subjects
i will get 7 in ielts test and learn a second foreign language in order to improve my language skills
i think there may be more factors hindering my progress but i will seriously reflect on myself and make reasonable solutions
the atmosphere of the whole classroom is different
in some ways the structure of the course is even very reminiscent of my bsc lectures during term 1 are assessed right after christmas
the task is more complex and specific use the models learned in the class to the real business plan4
critical thinking6
but if something goes wrong in the company you may lose your job
from my point of view the ethic is really important and we should follow it since it related to our reputation and the environment profit doesnt mean everything
there are also foreign teachings that pay more attention to the establishment of basic concepts
in a field i am familiar with or encounter a topic i am familiar with i will be very active in solving problems or completing tasks
therefore a reasonable arrangement of my personal time and how to balance my study and life is also a very important issue for me
i don  t need to practice language in my hometown9
because references are the basis of our essay whatever we write we need evidence to be our basis and then we argue and we come to our conclusion
i don  t like my university in china so i didn  t get goodgrades in my university
it has been a great pleasure to know them finally
most of lecturers are good at presentation skills
full of logical thinkingthe lecturer had a good sense of humoryesthe organization and connection are very goodit is easy for me to follow
i will follow these principles although sometimes they are challenges
and it did change my thinking about the programme which is composed of half management and half technology
sometimes the teacher will show the relevant words sentences or pictures on the pptthis will arouse the curiosity of the students to know what the teacher is going to say next which will help the course move forward。
whats more is it important to communicate with them especially when challenge occured
they were patiently listened what i said and responded actively
i think there are two elements for successful collaborative learning
im happy in the group work about building a paper tower
how i can utilize information from them into my assessments and assignment
there is a long time between my expectation and my action
there are many ways in which i can say that the last two months has been the best learning phase of my life
and there are many differences between the study of msc degree and the former one
so i believe i can organize the group better in the future1
i wish we could have more chances to get to know each other
again group activity was great it helped us to get to know each other even better
compared to what i have experienced in the past the teching style is more beneficial for me to achieve professional knowledge
and eye contact is also important element in the lecture it is helpful audience attention and it is expression of performance
however i think we can set some extensive introduction of professional courses to suit for the global technology development
the most surprise thing is that we are unintentionally divided into two groups based on independent learner and passive learner
but it didn  t work out so well because i had no clue about lots of stuff on the slides
the whole process is gradual and reasonable
in se students always need to finish their work individually
how do youorganise your reading assignments
in china a lot of work is individual but there are many group work in uk10
it makes difference with those people who can or can not manage his time
however i prefer the style in uk
once my friend and i were playing games
the lectures have been designed very well
first of all hard study is a very necessary factor for a success a wide understanding can help us start to succeed otherwise even the starting point can not be seton the other hand learning to share with others is one of the conditions to help us understand success
if we have problems we need to solve them ourselves so when we feel that the amount of knowledge we can get in class is too small we can go to the library or use the internet resources to learn by ourselves
i want to try something new i think it will be interesting
they could answer our questions clearly timely and they could always gave us instructive feedback if we asked by sending email
the answer is that the task is only a learning task but the task is not completed efficiently
before i became a postgraduate student of university of yorki thought i was not a serious person
yesis the teaching style i expectedwe have our group we have some activites that need all members finish together
it seems like there are so many assignments and pressure that i need to deal with
yes i surely think it will be a life changing experience for me
at the same time i was truly understand the meaning of team work
my course is mainly about writing programming languages
all the activities were really helpfulthey taught us know how to use the tools in the school to make our report more professional and wonderful
i think all lectures are interesting except law
everyone learns in different way some people like to take notes by using computer but some people prefer pen and paper
finally the problem was resolved
but when i ask them questions they explained it to me very clearly and logically
you can even learn on it by yourself
firstly sometimes i tend to make decision to fast
collaborative learning is when everybody gives their opinion orcorrect the ideas from others with plots
there were a lot of 2 or 3 credits modules and for that reason we had a lot of different assessments exams and lectures at the same time
the lecturer here is more accessible and friendly
or go shopping in the city of york sometimes give some inspiration to my marketing coursedifferences 1
i can freely arrange life and study time6
there are always people who are absent or leave early for personal reasons during group meetings
so i need to spend more time to adapt the course and i really like the studying of this course7
basically，each class will have a specific topic to discuss
i seldom ask question but lecturers are always glad to answer our questions and every students asking questions they would repeat their question to make sure we are understand
we will encounter more complex and more difficult problems to solve inthe future
the course of the msc in em is totally different with my undergraduate degree
the study here inaddition to the discussion in the class is more personal selfdiscipline
they both showed us how to make a wonderful presentation
go to the lecture now i  m trying to improve myself in that way and waiting for the result come out time will see i think that efforts will be paid offi still could remember during my undergraduate course because of my mistake i missed the deadline was late about 10 mins that let me have 10 off in my result
i have been here for nearly two months and i think i have adapted the life and study style of york perfectly
we are required to have activities with supervisor group members which aims to train our leadership ability and cooperation ability
if you have confidence and domain of the topic but the lecture lacks passion then it will hardly succeed
i also hope to make progress in my studies and get distinction scores
this will make them spend more time
firstly before i came to york for postgraduate study i seldom experienced collaborative learning
he likes to play music so he spend most of him time in music
then draw a conclusion about the issues we should be aware of while doing the international busines
i tried to make note in all classes however i think it is a little bit difficult for me to write down all important points
the lecturer is very patient and he would answer our questions clearly every time
when all our senses are motivated we canunderstands better
there is too much jargon in this class and sometimes even i have previewed the content i cant keep up with the teacher
in our groupthere are 3 workexperienced men and 3 women without work experience
having one more friend may provide one more solution
to be honest i have never been exposed tosuch moral statements before so there are situations in which there areviolations of the rules
all the lecturers are so confident to talk in front of so many people
in my observation some students like to sit in the front maybe this can help them study well
to be honest i am really sad about that
the main way of learning here is to study independently
she does answer the question efficiently
my first degree is in china
i have been studied at york for two monthduring two month i feel i learned lots of ways to study
because when you finish yourstudy in the library you should not careful the safety problem about come backhome
firstly lack of planning is an important shortcoming during my academic study
at the same times i feel anxious about starting or deciding on a taskand then i hope that i can postponing it until later thus coping with myanxiety
there are a lot of exams in china but in uk i have less exams to complete3
im observing that not many people participates in class maybe because the different culture or difficulty to speak in english but i think it would be good if we all try to participate more
in my view i think the induction was very boring but after the induction i found it is funny
the cue column is used to record some key headlines of the whole class and the note taking area supplement the details of the key headline
i find people who are native citizens are really friendly because they usually ask some one weather need help
actually im good at making ppt and speech or commuicating with others not very skillfully but i think ill be valuable to deal with these challenges
so i am really pleasure about the induction program
i endeavourto plan ahead for all my reports in masters as i want a good grade whengraduatinganother unproductive habit of mine is not letting go ofminor details easily i can be a perfectionist which means i waste a bit oftime refining mundane issues
all in all if i get a academic work aim confirmation knowledge application communication and research are my solutionsevery students wish to be a distinction grade student and i am no exception
however as the lecturer in my program have plenty of knowledge in this field therefore in their class usually there are some difficult but interesting thing which is not quiet related to the course itself and they are exactly what i want to take a note
i often encountered some problems during the work and i feel that it is difficult for me to deal with the problems using my current knowledge reserve and management skills at that time
all of them are placed on the study and the tasks of each course are completed in strict accordance with the quality and quantity and strive to achieve the desired results in the assessment tasks at all stages of each course
the knowledge of learning is more profound
but because of laziness irarely read the articles
the different timelines of team members influence the time of team discussion and collaboration
for example two members expressed a point of view but caused disputes because of different angles and methods of expression
however it needs a wellorganized time management7
due to the diverse nationalities that are represented it is some how difficult for some folks in the group to put their thoughts and inputs into an assigned task with the use of english language to comprehension level
3people could damage natural environment when operate the engineering projects
i saw research on different cultures in different countries
there will be many opportunities for collaborative learning in the future study
she is happy to share her thoughts with everyone teamwork continuous improvement of her ideas and a small idea into a mature and implementable plan
by the learning effects of these five weeks i acquire knowledge and enjoy the process of lectures
and dealing with socal relationship well is another key skill
i am a person who advocates freedom so my thoughts will be less practical
although i can not say that all the decision i made were prefect once you have made a decision you must try you best on it
i think many of lectures are logicaland humor
more reading and thinking more exercises and projects5
secondly during the lecture some studentshave hungry and others are chatting with their cell phones
if so the task assignment will be unreasonable
some points of slides are usually marked in red i think it is possible to be the test questions so i will comment more on them
the teaching style of my first degree is teaching us formula and give examples in class2
i think this is a very important point
i think the all the lecturers defined are very well
in the following explanations she will combine ppt to expand the content and introduce it to the actual engineering field
therefore i can keep up with her easily
i will practice how to use body language and attract audiences attention before i give a lecture
my team members and i will take theinitiative and assume the tasks in the group
we had at least two hours for one lecture a week and we hardly reviewthe lecture until the end of semester because we dont have many assignment atusual
we should not be afraid to learn about cultural differences through communication
in the busycollege life different students have different academic attitudes
i understood that listening to the class is not the only study way
because different people have different family background and experience we will have different attitudes to the same thing
however they are all friendly which seems fundamental for successful collaborative learning
then a good leader is also very important because we need someone with good leadership to lead the team to discuss organize and summarize
teachersprefer to use the carefully prepared slides to teach
i got 22 degree finally nearly 21 because i screwed up in my second year whatever how hardworking i am in the final year it didn  t work
many times we need to think backwards in the opposite direction
moreover msc engineerings teachers will be more humorous there will be much interaction with students in the class2 the nature of the profession is different
i will discuss more deeply the themes of course with mymembers of group so that i can expand my knowledge
in the past we hardly have these similar activites
we should have our own marketing strategy to sell the products
according to the experiences shared with other group mates and me i think there are several reasons why some cooperative tasks are unsuccessful
different holiday time7
in this case i have to stay up late every day and result in a bad physical condition
actually i havent met that situation yet
also being a good listener is essential to work together
i am not sure this change is better or worse but i know im changing now
this will waste a lot of my time
because i need to write in english and some of my work need to discuss with my team mates
to deepen students memory encourage them to agree and arouse their enthusiasm3appropriate interaction：this is the main way for instructors to get feedback4deal with unconstructive behavior：in the lecture some students words or behaviors obstruct others learning or affect the normal presentation of the lecturersthis situation needs to be handled in the right way5time control：the time of the speech is limited so the lecturer needs to convey all the information within the limited time
therefore i am afraid that i will make some grammar mistakes in my report which might influence my grades so i spend lots of time when i am writing the report and tried to make my language more professional
there are many public areas for us to discuss and learn
with people from different background studying together it is good to know about them in person when working in groups
the lecture must be taught in the syllabus
but unfortunately they wouldnot like to
in my opinion before coming to the uk most chinesestudents are not all active in their study which means that the learning stylewill have a transition that is not adapted to the habit
teamwork activity works great
as soon as it starts
when moving to next point the subheadings are helpful
yesthere are different induction surprised me
the time of study after work usually is only4 to 6 hours a day
the assignmenthas the upper limit of the word instead of the lower limit this is veryinteresting because in china teachers often ask us to reach a certain number ofwords
people here are more gentle friendlypolite
in this way i ensured that the problemscould be solved since different perspectivesthird critical thinking is important because give asthe opportunity to analyze the problem from different perspectives to membersof the group
i have truly understood that manyhands make light work there are always some creative ideas appears after ourgroup discussion as the achievements of our brainstorm
the first is to enrich their knowledge reserve to provide help and support for the task of the group
i think the most important thing about groups is their individual initiative the socalled bucket effect
therefore it takes me lots of time to adapt to the new environment
i learnt that i will have a lot of group work including the final project
now， i often review the content in the class after classes and i am not very satisfied for my academic work because i can not follow the teacher completely
i studied in china
norms should change with the situation so that the group does not become rigid paranoid or divisive as a result4 build trust and promote open communication
i worried about there is a big gap between those two fields but i learned that our programme much more focuses on how to be a good manager which surprised me a lot
the brainstorm of pictures was the best part
i think this is most helpful and we made friends in the session
i understand the direction of my progressin the end everyone in our group wants to do their homework as much as possible
lectures focusing exclusively on maths are very difficult to follow and usually boil down to having to repeat everything from scratch at home
1divide each persons task in advance2confirm ddl in advance3supervise everyone to finish the task in time
it must be the teamwork on building a highest paper tower
working together with different styles of people may make work more productive but sometimes there is a tension between the solution of a problemthe individual believes that this problemis ambiguous
as for the reference i have previous experience of writing the report in english and use the harvard reference style
the lecturer  s words are humorous and will inadvertently say something to adjust the atmosphere
it will make you feel so safe that you can resolve problem rationally
the most important thing for successful learning is the discovery of the drawbacks of ourselves
i didnt reply to the message because i didntwant to go to the library to study especially on weekends so i stayed in myroom and played computer games all afternoon
what i can see is that most of students are chinese and most of us prefer to sit in the front of the classroom we hope to understand more about what the lecturer said
when i recorded keywords andthen i couldnt remember the whole sentence which i need to be improved
trusting each other is a prerequisite and timely communication is essential
the ppt of each class will probably be 20 to 30 pages covering all the knowledge points of a chapter
after the first week i find the course which is related to law seems to be interesting
i think collaborative learning can be used in many ways in the future
besides i completed my premasters study in the uk with honorlevel 70 mark in professional subjects as well as 69 final mark in languagestudy
of course this is also inseparable from the companionship and help of friends
managementof technology aim to explore technological innovation
they will remind me of the prestudy before class and will be very active after class
conducive environment is important for collaborative learning to thrive
in workplace this would not be accepted and would not happen often but it happens here
at the moment im feeling very good for have chosen the university of york so i can improve my professional skillsthe major differences between my first degree and my msc in em are the close relationship with the professors and how accesible they are if we have any queries the way of working more into groups and less individual how the lectures are taught more dynamic with more student participation more international people which brings different points of view the lectures look more professional since its a master program the lectures are more interesting the different language from mine makes me work harder
each group has a supervisor who will talk to everyoneregularly about our study and life which is very warm
and also in some situation your boss will make bad decisions and i should decide to follow it or not
however i am writing this 500 word description of myself at 9 o  clock on sunday morning
her slides are clear
obviously the biggest difference is language
it is so deep scope that i feel it hard for me to understand
i think unconsciously speaking chinese is not a good habit
yesi think they are similari am satisfied with the teaching style
of course i want to be a distinction grade student and i will try my best to do that but it is a challenge for me
i get used to indicating possible test questions and most of time i got it
when coping with my academic work i am really responsible and try my best to finish each part of work well
finally i always looks hurry just before the deadline
in york at the postgraduate stage due to the short length of schooling we only had major courses
blue pens often be used to record contents acquired from instructions in classes red pen is usually employed to mark some questions and problems waiting to be solved black pen is usually used to add complements when i reviewing it after classes
different difficulty
if it is needed to solved the communication and trust is very important
if i am in a groupi do not have ideas about topic
i will not have a high efficient and quality in my work if i stay out because of sleepy
so i do not have enough time to write down the notes except for some key words
although i organized my notes very well i cant indicating possible test questions i think
1members are divided in opinions and mire in gridlock2someone has an off day3someone does not finish hisher task4having a bad communication and emerging conflict5members are attracted by other things such as chatting
but during these time i found i usually can not finished the things i decided before
the team has got really interactive after the induction sessions which made us know about each other
i think my concerns are really small and unimportant
yes of course i can hear them clearly even if i sat in the back of the classroom
and he is engaged in eyestoeyescontact
most of them will have a process of asking questions and solving problems
i think dr baruahs lecture is the most logical one and dr jhons lecture often use some humourous examples as for dr norths lecture she can always help me move from one point to the next
i think these principles are the essence of our working life
：i think i still need to work hard on the rae ethical principles like promoting high standards of leadership and communication and keeping my knowledge and skills up to date
if you know the possible answer you should raise your hand
1 listen actively to others2
at the moment after induction i cant gauge the teaching stylestandard properly so i wouldnt be able to give an informed opinion
when i am writing articles whenever i want to use some literature i will record the materials i need and write down the corresponding citation information which is indispensable for a serious academic field
when i was younger there were some situations where was easier to go in a way opposite to the ethics
what i mean is not just guess i always combine the focus point and difficulties to think about possible test questions
taking the notes of these would save me plenty of time and let me understand the information clearly
in my opinion no matter what he is an engineer or a staff in the relevant apartments he or she should abide ethics and regulations or laws
there are only 7 students in my class
finally i would like to say that because the library is open for a long time i feel that the learning atmosphere of york university is much better than that of my previous university
the significance of the research background is also clearly expressed
i remember that one failure was because of this
we can go there anytime of the day and study
on the other hand in my personal tasks i can also seek help from the group so that i can find useful information and information faster and more accurately
everyone has different opinions and sometimes can not agree on the same goal3
the definition of a good student is often misunderstood as a good student
frankly speaking every teacher is very serious which means they will teach you things according to what they know
noel always put a smile on his face and that makes me have a good mood to study
like the team work
to share about a situation even for my uk visa application i applied for it just three days before my travel
making a good slide
in china there are almost only lectures but also many kinds of seminars and workshops in britain4
additionally we should always raise the question to the konwledge we did not familiar with and keep contact with our teacher to solve the problem
time flies too fast i really cant believe i have been studying and living in york for more than two months
additionally the part of introducing the language center and library and research technique can improve my writing and referencing
not done sufficient group work to determine challenges
reflecting on your own notetaking is very much lacking
there are a lot of presentations to do and it isvery common to have a 3 to 5 minute pre
in my opinion communication is the most important thing in group activities
and i only take down something important and focus that the lecturers have taught
eve our study goals
first is im not good at writing so the first thing i want to improve in this year is my writing skills
in the past teaching the content of the weekly course will be more stressful than the current one
one month ago i successfully passed the presession with good grades
besides i gradually recognise that the foreigners are more confident and active than our chinese
students preview by ourselves after finishing their homework
so i think it is necessary to review our notes and solve the problems in time
the behaviours can range between students who are eager to learn and ask numerous questions tot he lecturers to students sleeping at their desk
20 of the time is the most energetic
for some of the current new ideas and issues my analysis and thinking model is usually onesided and the critical spirit is insufficient
i have not been an engineer
when we have trouble in thinking something about lectures she always helps us move from one point to the next
we study the law via the case study and some basic knowledge
i didnt notice others behaviours so i cant describe them
i know that i am not as professional as the principles said nowbut i think i can work to these principles in both my taught msc and working life in the futureand i think the most challenges for me is leadership and communicationi know that i am not a person who is sensitive and keep focussing on the the issues that engineering and technology raise for societyand maybe i am not confidential enough to promote public awareness and understanding of the impact and benefits of engineering achievementsthat is also the reason why i am back to school for my master degreeanyway i will keep improving myself and enrich my knowledge technical and management skills to make sure that i can shoulder the responsibility as an capable engineering manager
its not so slow that we couldnt learn much and its not too fast to understand what the lecturer said
tracking can be done through the project task listonly by decomposing the work tasks to a very detailed level can we finish them better and more attentively
i will keep paying attention to my own volume and keep an eyetoeye connection during the talk
so during the team work the members who learned engineering or business would spent more time to impart necessary knowledge to stimulate the working process or help us solve problems
the most important thing is that to understand what teachers say at first and then take the focus points down in textbooks
i expect there are more and more students can concentrate on teachers and take the important things down
we can solve problems with each other and help each other
at present i am coping fairly well with the workload i dobit by bit so i don  t have to leave it last minute
nowadays i think this course focus on practice and cooperation with group
that is another difference
obviously sarah was not happy and said that she was very disappointed with our performance today because no one was fully prepared
how to protect the interests of the company while taking care of the public interests
i didnt take good care of other peoples opinions which made the process of our group work very slow
its a bad habit so i cant clearly know what to do and how to do the task
the teacher will tell us about the difficulty progress and assessment content of our course
so l think l can use it better from now on because a deeper understanding of collaborative learning is gained from the elog this week
for me i have never been to this course before so there are many questions and doubts
yes in my own opinion the induction part is a very important part before the msc courses it let me know much about how can i focus on my specific major in addition i can learn more professional knowledge it provide me with more space to manage my study target i can be offered much great education resources it is also a challenge for me to study in a foreigner country
i was energetic in the morning
this means i might dont have time to take note
equality is the most fundamental and important part ofgroup work
all of these personalities we can not control will become the barrier to make the team a unity
in this programme i not only increased the ability of teamwork but also increased mutual understanding with classmates
time flies and soon the firstsemester of my graduate studies at york university is coming to an end
some students ask questions individually after the lecture
consider other peoples opinions modestly correct and supplement the inaccuracies and imperfections in their original opinions and dare to admit openly their misconceptions and affirm the correct opinions different from or contrary to their ownautomatic control
but sometimes i want to write something iwill miss next information so i should change my method of note taking
especially i set a deadline for myself in different part
therefore it is easy for me to do the accounting part
activities like safety lecture and library skills are quite essential and helpful activities done with supervision group can be added more activities like listening to our alumni to talk about the experience are so interesting i think it may be better to add qampa time
firstly one essential thing is that everyone attend the collaborative learning should at least have some background knowledge in the topic that they will discuss
actually i seldom take notes in class
i think i will continue using collaborative learning in the future
the tutor always introduce the topic of the lecture and listed the subheadings which helped us to grasp the whole structure of the class
now i have made some improvements starting to use mind mapping which is a popular notetaking method
this type is timecritical and important
to be honest i do not like fish and chips and burger and other similar foods
so everyone could hear clearly during the lecture
no matter what nonproductive behaviors or bad habits i have i would fix it as soon as possible
we are in a study group everyone can play the special skills to help students in need
some may also feel superior to other teams and it is no meaning for he to cultivate the relationship in this group
for example thisweekend i originally planned to finish the blog homework and market researchsummary of enterprise course on friday night complete the study on elearningon saturday and have a vist to a friends house on sunday
for example the lecturer will ask a lot of questions during the speech and will also interact with the students
i think the most useful is the tower of york
i think the most helpful way is sharing our own thoughts and adopting lots of useful thoughts
express ourselves as much as we can
2 thinking in another way
communicationcommunication is a basic of a successful collaborative learning
but in fact it does not help me to learn much new skills but costs more than half of the independent study time
in the class some students always have new idea for teachers answermost students have their own friends cycle so when we leave lecture we dont have the chance to talk with each otheri would like to have a communication with more students i want to learn about their learning way and way of thinking
one more thing that ive observed its that people are very nice and when they talk they seem very smart
but it is difficultto do selfcontrol
the interaction with the teacher and the discussion among the students in class is the same as what i expected
the next day when i went to themeeting place with my team members i heard the three team members who went tothe library together the day before were walking and communicating what theylearned yesterday
secondly the group cooperation should be clear division of labor first select the team leader and then negotiate the assignment of tasks
i practiced many times before showing
be more confident to do presentation 5 ability to solve practical problems6
actually i just feel excited about the following courses even if it is difficult
yes this kind of interaction is what i want
each slide is very clear and concise allowing students to quickly find the point
i didnt have enough chance to evaluate their weaknesses
otherwise the company gain the enough profit but it is harmful for the longterm profit and the environment as well as the reputation
the main reason is that professor is very humorous at class who always use some simple and funny words and examples to explain theory
they can catch the detail easily and respond the question easilyin the class i expect to learn more case than in the university
the answer was that there was a lot of necessary concepts to do the module covered in audio signals and psychoacoustics module and they decided to split this two subjects first 56 weeks asp and lasts 5 weeks vaa to avoid repeating the same content at the first weeks
first of all i have to learn their confidence
i like to study when i want to study instead of treating it as a task
moreover the current professional in the west campus the overall number of people more and from the library and other places relatively close life will be relatively convenient some5 there has been a change in numbers between the students around them and the major of the previous msc
finally i think the most important thing is language
i have some chances to listen to the guest speaker from enterprise when studying engineering management while i have no experience like this before
there are 6 of members in our supervisor groups
howeverfor some other studentsthey spent very limited time on the group assignments and never show their opinions on assignments which is very detrimental for the success of the group
only when learning concentration improves learning efficiency can you be high
for success people who are serious positive and wellregulated would be successful probably for example shuai chen in my group group 3 is always make plan about our group assignment in this way everyone could range their timetable in advance
then is the style of teaching foreign teaching styles are more inclined to selflearning
additionally novel and innovative ideas spark through the discussion which is the most attractive and charming point of collaborative learning
i have moderate preference of extraversion over introversion
in terms of the design of the lecture i think many teachers have done a good job
about the academic work i am lack of much expertise
this kind of responsibility is something i have not seen before in china
everyone work hard for the group reputation then the collaborative learning will be successful
yes i think i can study and work during these principles
forexample the previous course to write a code the problem can be explained bythe instructor
to be honest there are really some bad behaviors and bad habits that i need to change immediately
i have been studying at york university for nearly two months and i feel that i have gradually adapted to the educational methods and learning environment here
supervisor can provide many information to us
the results of undergraduate study are presented in the form of examinations
her behaviour has arisen a lot of interests for me and i will spend more time learning it
by variation of the time this conflicts can be more serious and finally it can make members generate negative feelings for each other
first of all everyone must be openminded to accept the opinions of others
and they can help us engage their lecture easily by some interesting activities
i think that it is a common sense and a important factor there are differences in a group in this way everyone could show their strengths and we could finish a project betteron the other handsome similarities during our group is also helpful which could improve our efficiency and we can be better by our communication and learn
724 open and full equipped library10
it is easy to be influenced by the things around me
this is the distinction of learning not of entertainment after alli can also give you an example of whats wrong with making a decision
in the lecture of several weeks i found that every teacher would have a slide in class
we discuss two or three times group assignments a week prepare presentations together and discuss the business plan of enterprise
i believe if istudy hard and try my best to improve myself i can get good results of mymaster study
besides they will also attach a url if the contents are cited from the internet
this would allow the knowledge to be spread to the whole group
once i pay more attention to take notes i can not chase the speaking speed of lecturer
in the past i only knew tofinish the distributed tasks and did not do other things4
so its often growing to be positive about the difficultiesbecause there are many differences between the postgraduate study and the previous study it often requires strong initiative learning ability
it tells us how to use our time effectively so time management is already there
now that i am mature i want to work hard to improve my professional skills during my studies so that i can find a better job in the futuresome of the obstacles to becoming a good student are1
and the suitable note taking methods can help everyone of our students improve the efficiency of study and enhance the understanding of knowledge when reviewing
many foods are much simpler
yes absolutely
in order to deepen the impression of students he played a game to make us better absorbed the knowledgejns couse is also very extensive but he also highlights key knowledge
every single class taught different knowledge to us because of changing teacher every class it is difficult to make a summary for last part and introduce new part
for a person who likes learning who doesnt want to get this honor
in thepast few decades i have rarely dealt with academic work
i think that group work is different from personal work and there are different experiences and gains3
also i amgoing to respect the laws of uk when i am driving my bike on the streets
this is because at the beginning of my university experience i tended to take worthless notes and ones that werent necessary
i can see the evidence of research or background knowledge of the subject in every course
i think my peers are good at spoken english and they can help me to improve my spoken englishit is essential to help each other as a teamas we need to achieve a common goal
this week we have a presentation need to do so i worried about it for 3or 4 days before
but i think how to find a good case in different topic is the most important thing which i need to learn
for academic work i have always taken aserious and rigorous attitude and understood the knowledge that teachers taughtto mei do not leave doubts until the next dayi always listen carefully takenotes and interact with the teacher during class
a few students dont turn up to many lectures not because they dont engage with the content but because they cant get out of bed on time
i have my own method to understand my notes
if i have a thing need to do i write it immediately to ensure remembering the things
the teacher  s nationality is not only a teacher in the uk but also a teacher from other countries
every view is logical and also focuses on interaction with the audience
i will write the bullet points which the teacher explained or write some examples i think it is very helpful for me to organized my notes after the class
in the past myprocrastination is very serious
then i start to take notes during the lecture not doing so well as always but sometimes i might get distracted by taking notes
sometimes i ask questions after class they behave kind and pleasure to answer any questions you mentioned
in the course of management of technology noel first showed us a lot of advanced technology and development process in the field of engineering
this will be the efficiency of learning is not high playing and playing is not fun
i am a coordinator and team leaderplayer
firstly because of cultural differences everyones attitudetoward work is different and what means it is difficult to unify the workprogress
in china we learnt the kinds of theories
however the failure ofchinese college entrance examination affected me a lot in my college life
in the future i will finish a large group project
and then i listen it again with the english subtitlethe second time help me to check that i really understand the meaning of thatlecture
i didnt want to face it
i also will learn importance of reference
i am trying my best to get to used to my life in york
i still remember in the first week teachers asked whether we want to be a distinction grade student i stood up at that time and never change my mind since that
and marketing it is my favorite class the contents are interesting and as not a native speaker bidyut s class is very easy to understand that made me very happy because its a little bit hard to understand the native speakers class
however i couldn  t stop because the game is very fun
it needs a large amount of time to do that but l realize that if l refuse to do it now it must be a hard time during the end of the semester
you know we have to write a serious of reports when we finish our courses and make a lot of research
through the understanding of each course i know that i can learn how to follow up on a project and how to manage a company
i think the passion and brave are essential to success to conquer the things make you uncomfortable to do what you are fear to do
as for me i tend to group teaching style and sometimes tutorial
i feel that my personal leadership and influence are not enough and i can not effectively lead the group which is also an ability that i am not good at personally
yes it is
these are the performances of playfulness and slackness
for other aspects such as different accentsleading to recognition errors or different opinions of knowledge by tutorsthese are what i expectthe first week is an induction week or anintroduction week
at the same time i think that as an engineer it is necessary to follow these principles
i think this is a way to let us undertand the course well3
i need to organize my time for personal issue and balance between study and play
i really think that test is very clearly and have lots of examples for us to understand it also gives us some situation to judge whether it is plagiarized or not
i think our group is very active and full of creativity but lack of action i am a person who like doing more than talking so maybe we can complement each other
because i enjoy the highpressure environment to challenge and break through the limits of myself
cause hesitation will lead to laziness
another variableis that lecturers speak very fast
the bar charts or the diagrams are always be used to illustrate key points which are visual tools to reinforce our recognitioni can hear very clearly the lecturer they are energetic and excellent teachersthey engaged with everyone with eyetoeye contact usually they never read the ppt and they are familiar with the knowledge they are going to talk about to us
because of the short period of two months i can only think of the abovedifferences
they are skilled at using references
under these circumstances only the individual ability sometimes can be difficult to cope with the various complicated difficulties and take efficient actions
after getting my undergraduate degree i worked for 5 years in a top 500 construction company about oversea projects
my first observation about the group i belong is communication language barrier
whats more depending on everyones own characteristics the group task should be allocated properly so everyone can make the best of themselves
i am really proud of that
yes i think i can learn from my teachers and classmates
during achieving the goali may have some difficultiesfirstlyi may have difficulties in time managementi may fail to manage time and finish task arranged by myselfsecondlysometimes i may lack critical thinkinglastlymy major in the undergraduate programme is not very relevant to the current programmewhich may make me have difficulties in understanding some subjects such as laweven though there are some difficulties which may prevent me from being a distinction grade studenti will make efforts to solve these difficulties to achieve my goal
ok
the other important thing that i find when studying with others is that both parties should be aware of each others needs in terms of pacing
for example if the group work is not properly allocated and is not completed according to the plan i will find a way to appease some negative emotions of each team member
so looking vle to see what is the criteria is a really important issue also in the courses lecturers might say using this skill you will get higher markthese means go use it
they always use body language and eye contact with audience and sometimes they are humor
let us understand better
i have not had group work yet
some knowledge background such as computing machine history and some programming language history
absolutely it is cooperation
making it perfect
second the above point just mentioned that the age of students is different that is the cultural background of students is also different
before the induction week i understood the references only for the authorship way but now after attending to the induction lessons i realized that referencing is also important to support my work
i also learned their excellent ability to handle things they use a variety of software to process data write documents and check information
his lecture is clear enough and delivered much information to us
and now in our major msc in engineering management 88 students are allocated into 14 groups each 6 students have a supervisor and 88 students have lectures together just like undergraduate courses
because attitude determines everything
not bad
this could be in the form of friends paying you a visit or inviting me over for coffee or other social functions and sporting activities
this is also useful when looking back at lectures because i can see from the first slide what the content off the lecture is to quickly find the material i am looking to review
second they will answer questions patiently and will continue to explain if i dont get it
yeah that is what i want
but in uk i found all of our teacher emphasis the understanding of the knowledge rather than recite the knowledge
however lectures are common at here there are usually more than 100 students in a lecture2
i think communication and leadership are important
i think my main problem is that i often cant grasp the key points that need to be recorded
firstly im a overseas student and english is not my native language so maybe sometimes i cant understand the lectures in the classes
theway that each culture learn is different
however learning from each others strengths through teamwork and collaboration can help us make the idea perfect
second the team members have no sense of responsibility
the time is the same
i feel surpised about this programme which i have not experienced beforei do not have any concers
here professors have more interaction with students and the pace of the courses is faster
neither surprised nor concerned
other courses are very logical but there may not be many humour points because of the nature of the course or there may be cultural differences that we dont capture
innovation task could have done with some introductory activities to get to know the people in the group better
but some classmate leaves assignment to the last minute
i think those group activities surprised me most through those activities i became familiar with the group members quickily
i expected that most of them would interact with students from other walks of life as well
if i don  t follow this rule i could be fired
and to be a better person
when my teacher explain some academic nouns and analyze some importantcases i will record them on my notebook
leaving works to others without doing anything is intolerable2
if we face some challenges first of all we would discuss about the problem together which could bring some new understand to us due to different thinking style in this way we could gain a outlet about our problemssecondly we would share the different parts and each one would be responsible for a part and find useful information and elements for our problemsthirdlywe need to collect all the information that we found and have a discussion we could exchange opinions each other and take a conclusionfinally we might ask our supervisor or relevant professors about our solution and take a further promotion according to their suggestionsevery one will hardworkingincluding me because we are filled with positive energy we are not opponents but friends which help me becoming better
most of them see the same document that teaches shows in the screen
i am so grateful to that 4 weeks
3 in the past teachers explained all kinds of knowledge to us and we just need to listen but now sometimes we need to feedback concepts or topics through many different ways such as drama in the class of international business
nothing really surprises me
it is critical for students to gain more suitable intellect
in my opinion successful people must be a bit hard about themselves such as apple founder steve jobs the reason why apple is so strong and his own pursuit of perfect and accurate personality is inseparable
the final project asked students to work in a groupwe can get familiar with each other and exchange ideasobviouslyi strongly suggest that in some common projects or activities we can change our group members from other groups because we can get opportunity to contact with more people especially foreignersi mean in some groups they are all from one country
for our professional courses notes are not the only ones to learn professional skills
i like to sit in the back of the classroom i can hear all the lecturers clearly because in big classrooms they will have a microphone to enlarge their voice
it is really easy to understand what they want to teach
for example most of time i tend to finish the work just before the deadline instead of complete it in advance
because some students like to think and solve problems independently and some students like to solve problems through discussion and brainstorming
i think this is a weakness of all chinese students
in general i  m very happy with my all improvements
through this group work i found that a good leader is important which can improve the efficiency of work
and connecting all the points together can make the lecture flows more logically
for example ilimit my playing time every day play games on vacation and urge myself tostart reviewing and previewing early every day
the behaviours that ihave observed are three
maybe i have few concerns about the year ahead because i am not good at learning in english
he guided as very well in process of learning
someone has bad habits like being unpunctual which make others unsatisfied
yes it is good
it is my honor to study in this university so i should cherish the time and opportunity here so that i can make myself better
each member has his or her own area of expertise or favorite
after that they would answer my questions and make me understand as much as possible
we also are allowed to have some time to discuss with our course mate during the lecture if the time is okey
from the collaborative learning i found that group meeting is very essential
dr ward shared the basic backgroundknowledge of it and point us to the right direction that  s how we get thiscase analysis done
noi hope more interaction
use my own practical action to motivate everyone
everyone can actively express their own ideas and are willing to accept the opinions of others and make a good combination of everyones opinions
the teaching style is different with the past experience
i just hope that our group can finish the work efficiently in the scheduled time for group discussion and can meet with others in spare time to enhance friendship and separate work time from life time which will make both our study and life more fulfillingto this question i think i need to learn in this year that how to regulate my emotions and pace to adapt to other team members because they may have different with me about character and execution behavior
as an engineering manager i believe that i can abide by the above principles in my future life and work
the european countries are really beautiful and the social culture is completely different from china
it was fun to go and visit some of the finest places in the city during the first few days
some of my knowledge and skills are not up to date which is contrary to the rae ethical principles i should try to keep my knowledge and skills up to date to be a qualified engineering manager
have some eye contact with the all audiencesand don  t always stare at one people
the lecture slides are very readable with clean and professional colour schemes and general themes overall
for example she gives gift winners
in britain taxis are not only expensive but also haveto be booked by telephone
however the lack of execution of the plan and poor time managementhave cost me a lot of time
i will always start to write it in sunday while this time i will always be busy with so many things need to be done together
it is good behaviour which will foster cooperation and success
he said heres a container with some big rocks some small rocks and sand
besides they often use their body language and give audiences eye contact
every time after each part of the class the teacher will set aside for us to ask questions
effective planning teamwork etc
now the master is studying engineering management2
secondly in the speech it is necessary to make full use of slides as well
it is so fun and interesting the part of teamwork is so amazing
i have a litter confusion about this coursethe voice of lecturers are so loud and suitable that i can hear them clearly
i will read more materials about different cultures and find out some good ways to solve these challenges
as i saidbefore the design of this lecture is also divided into two categoriesfor practicalcourses more attention is paid to cause and effect in other words moredependent on the construction of code
some students in my supervision group have strong learning ability but their interpersonal skills are weak
chinese prefer to listen the thinking from other people firstly and then with their own thinking
i cant say if i gained any particular insights to be honest
in the university of york there are intelligent and effective machines helping us to borrow and return the books in the library7
the next is the eye contact with the audience
3in the uk everyone discussed each other and have teamwork to complete more homework
i think that since this is my task i must do my best to do the best do the most accurate and do it step by step
i thought that the induction programme was good but i think i would have preferred to begin the audio technology related aspects of my course earlier in the week
last but not least i should improve myself day by day
so i could ask some question
finally i may bea little lazy sometimes
in the beginning of master class i try to follow teachers to write down the content according to the ppt but i found that this way would make me lose many useful knowledge point
yesthe britain teaching style highlight the interactioncritical thinking and group corporation
then we have different roles in our group and before we have a group meeting i will make sure i do the preparation and do think about these challenges
so i think i have got a lot of business training and useful experience myselffor the teachers teaching style i personally very much like and adapt
maybe the activity to build a paper tower was most helpful for me
first time i tried to make core points into the pictures and l failed
yesit is
its a common phenomenon so we should respect to the differences
because i have a team we need to discuss and find the choice or decision make every teammate happy with it
at the same time listening ability is also needed in communication
as the times go they gradually be tired to studyor life as everyday they have to read a list of references
the music community
shixian showed his actor talentalejandro have good skill in recording the video
i think the most obvious part of me which prevent me from being a distinction grade student is that i have procrastination for a long timesometimes also i had a perfect timetable or a plan before weekend and i was very satisfied when i have written them on paper like reading a chapter of a financial book going to gym doing writing exercise learning from international coursesthen i must regret and be disappointed when weekend has gone because the plan wasn  t be put in to practice as usual
an evidence is that we won the competition of the tower building
do other things not related to class with his or her phone or laptop3
suddenly the mood of homesick and fear start to spread like wild fireno one wants to do anything anymore and some people start to consider goingback home
whilebusy dealing with various deadlines i think this is a good time for me toreflect on my learning and life changes and my responsefirstof all york is a city with beautiful scenery no doubt about it
once there is a question that i do not resolve in time it will become bigger and bigger like the snowball in the future
my mother criticizedme severely and i realized the seriousness of the problem
when problems arise we dont just blame each other
he always took notes with steel notes and listened to the class very seriously
i am afraid that i will not understand the lesson
commitment and determination to excel in ones endeavors2
i believe that good students must have selfmanagement selfawareness selflearning and more importantly selfconfidence
and whenever you have questions you can just raised your hand and teacher will answer you immediately
but if we still can not make an agreement we may use other methods such as vote
of course in terms of academic attitudes i feel that i should still make a comprehensive reflection
so as a postgraduate student i would liketo put all my opinion on the assignment finding the evidence to support myidea
what i want to achievethis is a personal effort
the induction programme made me think more creatively about my own learning
my first experience outside of my home country
firstlythe lecturer defines main contents by our own curriculum design and schedulethey choose our course contents step by stepthenthey may judge which are the proper sources
in my opinion academic work is the ultimate goal ofour study
that was not what i expected but i feel like it would be beneficial to my future career
in order to avoid this incident we should talk more share our ideas and try to understand each other
but in my opinion in sometimesthe lectures are too long
by being in an academic setting it will be more productive to complete work and less chance of procrastinatingplease note that this is me responding to this exercise with situations in a theoretical setting meaning this is not always the case and this only serves as illustrating the potential ways that i could be distracted
there are three differences between team and individual in my work
i think its quite different from what i accepted before which might seem a little serious
at this time we dont have enough time to think so sometimes we cant get the ideal conclusion
i really like to learn with debate in group
besides it gives me some preparation of main course mentally
in order to achieve this goal i have to manage my time properly
although i am very happy with my friends this weekend but there arestill a lot of learning content left unfinished at this moment
i dont do this kind of work before so at first i dont know how to start this work and what kind of information need me to check
firstly i am surprised the induction programme
they are quite friendly and helpful so i think we can realise our study goals at the end of the course
term 1 reflection on the first induction programme sessionnow you have completed the induction programme you should reflect on it and answer the following questions before the start of week 2 the first teaching week
finally conflicts can lead to a failure team work if we do not handle conflicts immediately
therefore i will correct my academic attitude
this can help the group as a whole by applying hofstedes models of culture difference to become a more efficient group
in addition i believe that a modest learning attitude good study habits and innovative writing methods are also important
they are very useful
another important thing is reading relative sources because it can help me understand the subject
there may a lot of difficulties on the way to the distinctiongrade i would try my best to get that
everyone need exert strength of their selves
i have to mention that i skipped a great deal of these activities due to a back injury i sustained last monday
inaddition our major does not have a relevant course which means that the timespent on this log requires me to squeeze too much study time and sleep time tocomplete
the focus of the course is different
i agree with some of themfor example i really like those games during the induction period but i think lecturers may give more freedom of choice to us and let us become a group by ourselves i guess that will make us more active to join the activities
i was very embarrassed because i forgot some content and my classmates and teachers are waiting for me
that is really helpful
our tutors hope we can have critical thinking ability even we can query the knowledges they teach us
to achieve the distinction goal this is what i need to address
firstly you should be confident and ensure your voice can be heard in the whole class
i believe do your job well you will get your deservedness
tutors give us many interactive changes inthe class and we can give a presentation or a show which i have notexperienced before
actually a little surprising
now most courses are accessed by the presentation essays and group work but i always had tests before5
what i have to do is first pay attention to my way of expression making communication simple and effective and make sure our team has a clear and consistent goal
i can mimic the lecturers when i do presentations
on the one hand i could summarise key points during every lesson and give my views and questions on time i would check information online after class according my notes on the other hand it is clearly that i can use these note when i prepare my reports during the finial assignmenthowever i also came across a difficult that there are more models during our class and i can not use them in practice even if i make lots of notes like red and blue oceans
howeversome of them are with accent which sometimes make me can not understand clearly and some of them speak quickly so that i sometimes can not follow them
in the course of market technology the teacher talked about how to conduct market analysis of his own products such as his own market analysis product analysis target analysis
in addition i think that peoples energy is limited so we must make appropriate choices between learning and other activities
i think my supervisor group members are very motivated and we worked very well in the tower of york competition
through my observations i found that this may be related to the time and content of the lecture
actively answering questions from the audience
in the end our team worked together to complete this seemingly impossible challenge and won the final first place
so sometimes i feel that my learning attitude needs improvement
so when a group has some internal problems they can not do anything
lack of communication and understanding among the team memberssome team member refuse to express their ideas
this kind of style is quite interesting and to engage students in learning
teamwork allows me to better identify my own problems conduct reasonable analysis and through cooperation i can complete projects more effectively and timesaving
i think that is good for us to have a structure
i have not had many chances to work as a group with my course mates yet
so i always have a question that is harmony more important or efficiency
in my opinion there are many behavious can foster success such as serious attitude wide social circle and the ability of sticking to something
and she hoped that we could practice more for the formal speechafter the class i checked my ppt and decided to work out the framework of the speech
mainly are about the speed of taking
sometimes notes can not keep up with the teachers speed of lecture in this case i will review the video after class to make up for this part of the notes
when i was young i used to write down some notes for my referencing but now in my engineering modules i prefer to use a app in which i jot the points as it really saves some paper and also helps me make use of the technology
really difference way to use materials such as the the way use reference5
surprisingly i found there is the language center introduced by the induction session which can help me in writing the report
i will try my best to be an accurate and objective person
every teacher in our class would like to raise questions and they wish us to answer it actively especially for bidyutadditionally we seldom write the report in china during my period of the undergraduate and certainly every course we learned will have the final exam rather than the final report
akacitcc since my graduation
nonetextindent0pxletterspacingnormalfontfamilyarialsansseriffontstylenormalfontvariantnormalfontweight400textdecorationnonewordspacing0pxwhitespacenormalwordwrapbreakwordminheight89pxbackgroundcolortransparent langenbecause the members of our group come from different countries the way of education is different and the learning methods are different which leads to differences in the learning processi think that the members of the group understand each other and learning from each other will make the work more smoothly
only their own strength will have a qualitativechange
for example i need to get used to this kind of british weather and the shortday winter
however i am looking forward to meeting the challenges and finding ways to solve them in the group work
when i was in china i always played games myself or with my friends when i had time
they will answer my question whether it is the form of the class question or the form of the mail they will explain my problem to me as much as possible
i would write down a certain note here and there during these lectures if it is crucial information i need on demand
no enough mutual understanding and respect in the group for example somemembers insist to hold a group meeting when others are not so available so thesepeople have no choice but to change their plans passively and unwillingly
i likestudent society
i tend to do this when i get bored and breaks lessfrequently
i hope that a years masters course will be a new start for my study career
the whole project can be roughlydivided into several parts feasible study phase initial survey phase thoroughdesign phase operating phase check and accept phase and maintenance phase
but i realised a reasonable and suitable plan need to practice in several times
i think this kind of linkbetween different part of ppt is good
to achieve our goalswe can help each otherbe honest with othersbe kind to others
it can also help us to avoid some stupid mistakes
it really surprised me
as we always have presentation in international business we have to spend some time to prepare for it
from my perspective it is exactly what i want
they always engage with us eyetoeye to make sure we understand what they say
although there are many cases oral cases can not be particularly intuitive to understand
so i think they have a lot of things to learn for me
i used to be a engineering student
or does everyone can understand it if fewer people respond to him he will ask it again
in addition when people have different and conflict goals they can not make success in collaborative learning
but then i took some useful solutions
i am very eager to be a good studentas far as i am concernedi have a strong selflearning ability
this process should be modest and correct and thank each other after helpingsupport
in the induction i make some new friends from other countries and i find that i really like team work and enjoy it
everything seems to be great but one
after this lecture i realized how to write down notes is a systematic subject
because there are so many book or article in library oron internet which is impossible to read all of these materials for one personhowever collaborative learning gives the opportunity to summarize our knowledgeand focus in one theme
with the academic work but i also feel that i could do more especially by doing more further reading
yesit has many interesting courses and teachers are very friendly
in china if the teacher or professor give you a theory that you cant doubt about it face to face you must show your respect to your leaders and teachers
in college we all wrote our notes in our notebooks
give quality time to self study and make positive efforts towards improving on ones deficiencies3
at the very beginning when i knew my grade i chose to escape
for the part of consent think about why you agree for the part of disagreement think about the difference dont interruptseek help
i can calmly fight for what i want
the language of teaching of my first degree is chinese instead of english4
i think these are all good and can help us follow the course
this is an excellent example of how bad decisions choicesand attitudes apart me from what i really wantedthen one day i realized that i was letting go the time andmy opportunities
there is no doubt that the team will encounter difficulties
so it is important to have a good leader
i think the most biggest challenge is when facing the discriminationsome will solve the problem emotionallywhich is very detrimental for the development and cooperation of the groupwe should have more communication with each other to eliminate the barrier and form the common sense and group rules to complete every assignment
the number of teaching staff in at least one class was about 30 before whether it was seminar or lecture2the teaching content is also different
for example a pentagram means the most significant a triangle means very significant and a circle means normally significant
the time is relatively short so that we are more likely to concentrate in the 50minute class without distracting
they are very friendly people and will takeour questions seriously
when everyone has a plan things go smoothly and save time
the above is what i can think of to improve in academic work
in addition i also learnt how to balance my study and life in york and make my own timetable in advincein other words a plan about study and life
they are really smart and reaction quickly which is the best point that i should learn
whats more i also see marketing skills new technology self promotion and so on
the lecturer usually starts with the basic content
i think what i need to do is skim and find some key points and then read them carefully afterwardsmy next problem is to be lazy in speaking practice
on the other hand different people have their own personal habits so this difference of habits can directly affect the process of our team work
i will follow academic work no plagiarism fabricate cheating and find someone to help me write an essay
absolutely i  m aspiring to be a distinction grade student
attitude is very important it not only determines whether you can finish the task better or not but also the right attitude is the key factor for future success
every individual may disagree with others to a large extent and finish assignment in a way that he is used to2
for instance in international classes happened thiswhen two group chose the same topic brexit
the harmonious and mutual understanding are the most important factors
besides they give us a verity of information about our course and advice about study and life
keep these separate from the text of my notes either on a nearby page or in a separate notebook
so i decided to go back to college because i love electronic technology very much
no it wasnt
do you have any questions
when i was studying it is quite easy for me to focus on the other unimportant things or thinking about the other reports i have to write which is really affect my studying efficiency and the accuracy of my work
all of this ways help me can understand my note and review them effectively
now i just mark some titles which are important or tutors highlight
by this way i learnhow to study independently and plan my free time
because our teachers always speak slowly for us and try their best to make the expression be easy for our international students
sometimes lecturers would like to do some games in classes and express pointsmost lecturers do not use notes during their classes they just use key words by slides
besides there is no high speedrailways
and after class i will review these part and do some deep understanding
stabding point6
professorjhon issitt sometimes defines his lecture a little not clear
however i was not asked to express my opinion on thatexperience
we often have group discussions share the results of our work and have discussions
it is a habit to be prepared
thus i think i will have more time to focus on my homework and academic work
the big and the only problem is me
but i think they can slow down the speed of speech so that we can better absorb knowledge
when i still feelconfusion about something i like to mark them with green color which means i shouldask my tutor after class
this course allows us to get in touch with possible future work content and working environment and also understand and be familiar with it
because when everyone participate in the collaborative learning process the teamwork can work smoothly
every part of nj has a connection
the delivery is perfect
even in the christmas vacation i have no plans for the holiday and i just want to focus on my own reports
ireally never put effort on getting the required scholarship to achieve my goalmaybe because at that moment that goal was to far to my vision
compared with studying in china i have made some transition here
letting such a completely different five people work towards one goal will create a path to the goal that is not needed
add any explanation you want to add to each
last but not least i prefer to makefull use of weekends to do our assignment together
it is also very important to balance learning and entertainment in life
then they will carry out a stepbystep explanation according to their theme logically
i feel that the things i learn are more practical7
what i can do is first try to do my best to finish the work then if i can receive the feedback from the marker i could fins what i did wrong or what is correct
the study found that students who provided and received complex explanations benefited the most from collaborative learning
i also have some problems in taking notes
therefore i try my best to write down the abbreviation of the word in order to catch up with the lecturers
and we can interrupt teachers for questiones they will be delighted to answer the questiones
of course in the aspect of using references i think i have done a good job
but i have enough confidence to do every job and every task well
during the two months in york i have been unable to adapt myself to study and life and now i can slowly balance these two points
there are average two or less lecture everyday which means we got more time arranged by self
the slides are very logic and its also easy to understand
therefore we can have a deep understanding of the konwledge
this is also a way to improve work efficiency because when it comes to disputes for various opinions it does not help the progress of the work
i think every chinese student has a bad habit like this
we should be good at listening and accepting others opinions and come up with an excellent solution
in the past teachers prefer to give students many problems
now however most of them prefer to write papers
i am very excited and surprised by the course because i am very curious about the uk postgraduate program
i have pick up the note taking method of cornell now and it is efficient for my reviewing
but after several weeks i think i have improved my skill on reading and understanding
actually i think it meet my expectations
the firstimportant thing is keeping patient in study all the time which makes acontribution to high study efficiency
inthe several phases at beginning our company tend to put lots of man power inthe field and nearly 70 to 80 percent of the people will get back to chinaafter the design phase
some of lectures are talking about signal and c programming signal can be seen as the foundation of embedded wireless system which include how to recognize different signal in frequency and more c programming requires us to know how to operate sensor on computer and analyse data also some finance and marketing project provide an opportunity to know what it is because what we learned are about technic and lack of other abilitysuch as how pricing product and busness plan
reading i am requested to do much more reading in the msc than that in my first degree
personally i think the effective communication is the key point to achieve successful collaborative learning
but i think i will follow the instructions latter and ask advice from peers
besides many teachers like to show in the form of humour in class which makes me feel very interesting and relaxed
what i did in the lecture is just listening from the lecturer making notes of important points and so on
we all should keep positive attitude withevery assignment that we have
most areas are unknown for me and i have never realise before sometimes i need to spend double time in reading and checkinghowever i still insist to reading and accumulate new words i believe that it is useful in my work and reports
i think what i need to do is to prepare more before the talk
i just finish the homework and read some necessary bibliography for my study and i did not do some deeply research because i would like to play with others or hung out in the city centre or shopping i guess it is not reasonable and i should spend more time on my research and reading more references which is useful for my finial report and could improve my reading speed
in addition all the members are very patient and inclusive so that the atmosphere of discussion is very harmonioushowever the team members did not reach a level of familiarity so many group operations had no way to be assigned tasks reasonably
in the past i thought this classmay be the typical class
since beginning my masters course i have tried to put strategies into practise that address weaknesses that i identified from my previous experience
in collaborative learning team members needa detailed division of tasks
the teacher is very friendly to answer our questions
their lectures are very useful to get knowledge
making your own ideas clear and clarify and let your teammates understand what you are saying is essential
1 language studying in english takes extra time
they are good at regulating the atmosphere of the class and make it less boring
finally it will be summarized what have you learned todaytws curriculum structure is very clear most of them are case study and the knowledge is very deepjis curriculum has always been very humorous
thats the reasons why i become nonproductive sometimesbesides lazy can be the biggest obstacle for every student to get the distinction
i could feel warm and enthusiasm which let me do not alone in a strange country of course york is the city that i know best now3
i was very desperate in that part of time
when i try to only take the key words the problems have disappearedi often organize my notes by write the words in order
from the induction programme i can know the outline of this academic year and some useful skills in living and studying
because in china i have seen too many tragedies caused by some people not taking their work seriously
at the beginning of writing a paper or report i was not used to it and i was not very clear about how to rewrite the reference
this habit can help me finish the important work in a high quality
in the design of the lecture most of the lecturers did well
due to we want to konw about the previous study about the major the previous students who get the distinction were invited for sharing the experience with us
in my opinion the first reason that affects and prevents me from getting distinction grade is whether i can reasonably arrange my time and how to do the most efficient assignments and tasks in a limited time
i should use the powerpoint or prezi to make the slides
i write down my notes weekly or sometimes into the slides as well it helps to have a direct insight into the topic
i need more extra reading3
which always let me lose points in assessment
so how to handle this kind of conflict is the key thing for me to learn
everyonedoes not want to be responsible just want to do things as little as possiblewithout collective consciousness and collective honor and pay more attentionto their own interests
i observed that some students always have communication with teachers
i will do more preparation before the lecture to make sure i would have something to talk during the group work
what a surprise to found that that is not always valid
developing good study habits and a deep understanding of problems and knowledge is also an important skill especially for me who want to move to a phd
through several lectures in the class and performances of the melodrama i can feel the enthusiasm and commitment from entire students in engineering management
because i always listen to music or watch videos while i study and i keep the social software always opening which let me have to chat with my families and friends when they send message to me
there is a famous saying by napoleon “ every french soldier carries a marshals baton in his knapsack ”
when i say i take care of pets i have 3 fully grown german shepherds which require a lot of time to groom walk feed and play with
i always have some small goals and i try to finish them but i just can not guarantee the quality of every thing because of lacking of time or just feel negative to worki am kind of extreme because i could be passionate about those i am good at because i love what ido i have a steady source of motivation that drives me to do my best but i will feel very confused facing unfamiliar tasks and need a long time to get used to themi am not so highly organized
i will abide by the principle
i think time goes very fast
everybody have their own ideas which sometimes causes a disagreement so how to keep the balance between exchanging ideas and friendly environment seems to be a problem in our groupthen different people have different time table my plan may be influenced by other studentstime
i read some books about this too
the danger in this case is being overconfident which could result into looking unaware of different circumstances
these processes have helped me better understand the two strategic models
accommodation before college allocate the accommodation
for instance inour business plan cash flow was a problem
on the one hand i do not like this way of learning because it is not efficient and waste of time sometimes
if i dont innovate i cant achieve new achievements
data analysis also takes a large proportion
besides learning knowledge and completing assignments we could also improve our communication and cooperation ability to solve different problems
different is a important thing in the team because we can get different idea in the communication and get the best to deal with problem
lecture11in taiwan most of lecture and courses are oneside it is hard to engage in the lecture in uk lecturer want to interact with audiences12 in the lecture if you have question people just raise their hand and ask in asian people used to listen or maybe just the language barrier lead this situation for me sometimes i just think what is this meaning or i try to understand everything so i cant ask question as fast as native speaker13 lecturers are energetic shows they really love the topic or they are professional by contrast in my msc in taiwan some of the lecturers look like he just loses 100 million so unhappy and i cant feel any passion from himsecond assignment or homework24 when i saw my first homework i was shocked i need to make a paper made transport system
every one should be patient and peaceful otherwise it is very easy to result in quarrels6
this is the respect of every knowledge learner for what he has learned
learning interestmost students have been reading books for 20 years before graduate students
because the lecturers are not always read the slides
we used to live in a collective dormitory but now we have a room for one person which is quieter and suitable for study
as an international postgraduate student i know ihave to focus more on the academic work because the language is not my motherlanguage
however i think every lectures topic is independently
i think this way is helpful because i can take into account both writing and listening
particularly i like to take notes because i think that every thing that i write down will become mine
it is hard to tell how well i am coping my work
the rhythm of life there was no fixed rhythm of life before
7classmate is less than before getting on well with everyone is important8lecture become less than before so i should study by myself to import myself9knowledge studying is harder than before it means i should spend more time to control them10calculation is less than before but programming is more than before in the dse studying
1some group members are simply irresponsible fail to do their share of the assigned work and leave the rest of the group to deal with the irresponsibility2groups tend to have dominant members who often do the work monopolize the group discussion and carry less assertive members along with them3
i think asking questions in the session will lead to success
and both of them have their own advantageswhen the class is small it is easier to hold class activities and parties but i can make more friends when the class is large10i used to live in a singlesex dorm but now there are many boys and girls from different countries in the apartment which is a new experience for me
i believe that i need more practices about them and check more information about them because they are useful and efficiency during our work if i could use them expertly
obviously the lecturers are well prepared before the lectures
basically，i use two ways
therefore i decided to judge them separatelyinternational business the international business course is aiming to tell us about the different cultures in different countries and how can we use them to adjust our business in different countries
i realized that it is not a good habit
different people has different skilled field3
i have to say that i really like international business
the communist party of china is the best example of this model theory3rd today ‘ s society in this world there also in a strongly father sib culture so for a long history country like china also in a masculinity model
of coursethis major lists a lot of key course elements in our future career
firstly in my mind i think we should work hard
as there are lots of group work or case study to do our group almost have the meeting every day
the law for engineering management looksat the general basis of law and the impact of law on professional engineersworking in different international environments any provision of law is basedon english law
this we have done
firstly i think people who can manage time effectively is more likely to success
when i need to copy with some academic works i prefer to understand the work what i need to do and then i will check some information from internet books and the slides of our lectures
first of all our teaching plan has made me look forward to the year of study because in this years study i will have a very specific understanding of engineering management and will improve my future professional skills
this is good behaviour because it motivates to debateand everyone can learn more about the subject in this wayibby likes to askquestion in the class
this is because i always think too much i think that every idea has its ugliness and badness
firstly most of students from china speak their nativelanguage before and after lectures
diligentworkinghard in cooperative learning is also an essential factor
i usually learned to read my notes books becausemy exam was only about this this note book
i need to use this year to learn more knowledge which is usefulfor my future career
bme pay more attention on doing physical research while em focus on critical thinking part
a laptop to take notes the way although it was convenient and quick can greatly reduce my writing time however disadvantages is that whenever i read notes it is very difficult for me to find the notes of the key again the reason is that my notes are unified on the computer font and format highlight the main points is not very good
i have also found that all of the material that has been covered is of direct interest to me which has kept my study very engaging
as an example in our audio signals and psychoacoustics module the first slide that our lecturer covers is always a break down of the material that we will cover in that lecture
surprise i find that some classmates are really hard working
every lecture flows logically and coherent
and we can see the ppt clearly because all of them use the fonts which are big enough
i have carefully observe some interesting behaviours of my classmates which really surprise me
in such cases lectures flows well logically with lots of humour on a particular lecturer teaching digital design
take the recent distance halloween is near the streets around you the shops the campus and the topics that are talked about by friends around you will be related to halloween
i will find the differences between each team member improve my leadership skills and then give the most correct solutions
i can understand my nots when i review them
so i need to get rid of this bad habit
the teacher will not be the expert transmitters of knowledge collaborative learning focuses more on the students engagementsfrom so far l personally quite enjoy collaborative learning
first a topic of discussion or a topic of interestit is important to have clear idea what topic we are going to debate or whatproblem we are going to solve
of course the teacher must be an expert in this field and have a deep understanding of this subject
it helps me feel the customs and traditions of european countries and broaden my horizons 10
yes i will consider my time management carefully
is it too much work for himhowever collaborative still fun i can see what my teammates have a crazy and interesting idea
its difficult to find a good work life balance especially when there are a lot of contact hours
i especially like andys ios lecture
secondly i can not keep up date with my shortterm goalbecause i think it consume a lot of time to do these things
firstly they do have some ability which i did not obtain or excellent in such as creative
i think the worries i mentioned above is probably the main problems which can prevent me from being a distinction grade student
so it is a good way for me to know the different views of the world
the learning style ofmine here is active rather than the passive one in my former university
in addition group work can always expand some of your ideas
for example ios programming course give us knowledge from basic swift programming to the way to develop application with audiokit
sometime i will make some jokes to make the presentation more attractive and more interesting
there are four main points below1
however it also decline the efficiency in some degree
however i found that if you know what the teacher is going to do you can learn what the teacher said while taking notes
i will always attracted by others message or someone walking in front of my home
maybe in the future i should always remind them to do the group work and divided the work for them therefore they can participate in the group work better
i think msc courses need more cummunication
i know what this is for
for example many students use some social software to entertain in the classroom or watch some videos and ignore the classroom order
if it still cant solve the questions i will email my supervisor or ask my flatmate who is a native english speaker
outoffbalance in the group
group report develops our teamwork skills which is very useful in our future work
furthermore except for some good factors i have some bad habitsto prevent me to be a distinction student
for example ourgroup  s peru member spanish member and chinese members all have very differentaccents sometimes it would be hard for us to understand each other and we maymisunderstand others  opinionssecond all the members are not hard enoughor they don  t put all their attention to the collaborative learning
yes ，that is very nice and i hope it can higher level
：1
also i learn a lot through it1
then i think a logical presentation around this identified topic is really important
and it remains a lot of reading list to read several essays and papers to write
i expect that our classmates could help each other with study and everyone could study independently
sometimes one team can also hold a grudge against the other team member
thirdly research is also important in the process because not all problems can be solved by ourselves or by communication thus find solutions in the book or internet is necessary
because managing a team is not an easy work i have to keep every mate the same step
in the group work everyones ideas are different and the process of communication can continuously improve and integrate the ideas of the team members to get the final result
the students with different cultural backgrounds always have different perspectives on thinking and problems solving
whats more most lecturers here never do the roll call and dont havethe marks for usual performance
strictly abide by the rules of time management and complete the scheduled mission objectives on time
we hope that the cooperationbetween us will be closeralthough different majors in the course are divided into different groups each student is actively involved in class discussions
to improve professional knowledge my major is engineering management
yes it seems i can have more free time so i can manage my time by myself
i think my teammate have different advantage in the major and a successful collaborative learning may be each teammate can play their role in the team well and have a good communication
i think empathy and team responsibility are essential for successful collaborative learning
onweekends i just blindly stay at home and play online games and rarelycommunicate with others
inmy undergraduate studies the assessments requested were more flexible indesign
to ensure my work can be finished on time i will come up with a time management timetable to pinpoint every deadline and start making schedule for every working during the assessment
that isthe reason why the students always get lost when they were a fresh man inuniversity
and remember to get ready for my speech and practice a few more times in advance
practice makes perfect
on the other hand i am worried about the results
not being able to show myself will only prevent me from becoming a goodstudent
different teaching style5
i really want to have a big improvement in my msc course i want to be a good student
i think every course has their own logical and structural content which is very easy to understand and study
then why brand
large class teaching mode
at this time people must have this perseverance to complete itinstead do not to escaping it
through a lot of reading from different angles of observation reading analysis and then make conclusion8
last butnot least as i mentioned before i have worked for a year
if there are problems we must communicate in time
i learnt saysorryandthank you always i have said those words just when i need in my hometown
i can help my classmates improve their organizational skills
the ability of time management has been improved in these days
in the aspect of homework i am eager to do better than other students and get the satisfied results
try cooperative learning strategies where each student has a specific role for their group or where groups work in pairs within the group
i have analyzed this weakness there are 4 simple reasons as follows firstly the task seems too hard for me to do
now i always preview thw content in advance and look up the new words which proved that a good method
because of my visa problem i did not attend the activity but i communicated with my classmates in the formal class
it is very important to get interest from the audiences
although i learned most of theories in the university they combine with the case and help me think more
law for engineering managementthe lecture flowed logically and the lecturer could help me move from one point to the nextbut sometimes it was a little boringmarketing of technologyi think the lecture was designed very clearly and the lecture is interestingthe lecture also flowed logicallythe lecturer did well in helping me move from one point to the nextmanagement of technoloyduring this lecturei can move from one point to the next easily and it flowed logicallyinternational businessthe lecture was humour and i enjoy this lectureenterprisethe flow of the lecture was logicalstrategy managementthe designed of the lecture was good for memsc personal effectiveness and masterclassesi can learn more from this lecture because of its good and clear design
yes they can help me and i can help themi think listen respectand work together are essential factors
here the quality of work should be guaranteed at the same time so that while fulfilling the responsibility it also reduces the additional burden on others and improves the overall efficiency of work
at the same time i found that in china when i met some wrong operations i always ignored these mistakes even through nothing has happened so far i still violated that i didnt have the oversight role to all the people around me
because when we start thinking backwards the answers we can get may be different from the answers we are thinking about
i think they are quite useful for students to review knowledge
in this way we can learn efficientlyin terms of slides it is really perfect for us that we can download slides in advance and look through before courses
because they taught the class for many years and they know about their slides very well they neednt to use the notes to notice themselves the next point
when i was back and turned on the computeranother friend said that she was in a bad mood and wanted to go to thehalloween party in the evening to change her mood
after all everyone is notperfect
i should keep my confident and pronunciation cleari should make sure the content on the slides is clear and easy to readand the parts are very logical
actually i worry about my english languge level more than the programme indeed
for example in the lecture of management and marketing of technology the lecturers logic is very clear
i think most lectures were delivered smoothlyexcept this week  s enterprise lecture
failure to fulfill their duties leads to an increase in the workload for others
they will eye contact and interact with us
it provides me the most important ideas and topics during the learning process
i personally feel that collaborative learning is really important for a team
in the past i had only a limited knowledge in that area
one would expect that there should be interactions in such a meeting of diverse international and home students
for discussions with other courses becauseof the knowledge base of the course i can also contribute my ideas in theclass discussion
it is well thought and planned organised and coordinated with guidelines and support put in place to ensure the success of students academic and professional pursits is achieved
in addition i will use humour and rewards appropriately to attract more audience attention
not only promoted the study but also enhanced the communication ability in the task and promoted the relationship between students
this requires both creativity and hard work because the more in depth you get into any project the more you understand how challenging it can beon the other hand i can think of plenty of bahaviours that would hinder success
i believe that the teams that have undergone tempering will become more and more tacit and more tenacious
i am working hard to be a distinction grade student
im excited to gain a neoteric style of master degree studying
but you cant show everything you want to say on the ppt
some of the following is a repeat of what you have said before so that your supervisor sees a bigger picture of you and what you want to get out of the msc in emreflecting on the teaching you have observed what are their good points and what did you not like
we can use our advantages to help each others then every one will be improved
read a blog or browse an unrelated web page in class
but i finally comfort myself i have other members can help me with the task
this teamwork course helps us improve our collaboration and coordination skillsit would be better if each group activity could be changed to different team membersi hope that the campus could add some tour around york so that we can meet more classmates
moreover i often use different colored pens to mark different key contents and to show levels of siginificance
and during my undergraduate course i did not make some contributory statements within my professional ability
civil engineering has two term for 1 year there are three10
then i can achieve the best results of taking notes
knowing the different strength of each other then we can cooperate with each other to finish different parts
for me the biggest benefit of one years preparatory study is to learn the normal writing requirements in the uk because this aspect is very important for current graduate studentsbut in the aspect of research i cant master and use this skill well
hence i changed my method when i realized this problem
when i met some challenges i used to consult the lecturers
i have no concerns
first of all every student is eager to become a good student
in addition i can discuss problems and pursue knowledge with themthirdly it is important to have a constructive philosophy of life
another entertaining activity is learning spanish
as we have konw some basic information about each other we major in different subject in the past and i do think we can do better in group work
actually i have experienced this kind of introduction programme last year
at the beginning of learning i will remember what i write in the teachers courseware
i expected to have some communication with others to be a creator
in fact a much greater emphasis was placed on the latter with most of my marks determined from exams of which i typically had ten to twelve per academic year
all the team member should be aware of the importance of their separate part
now i write less wordin each lecture
because the team needs division of labor and cooperation division of labor is an important link if the division of labor is not clear it may lead to contradictions among team members or inappropriate allocation of personnel inefficiency2
first of all our members of the same group are all from the same country
unverisity of york is a very nice place becasue there are many different experience1
i have been in situations that are contrary the principles such as if i dont update my knowledge or allow others to be misled
on the contrary the attitude that you do not care anything and just live in your own word will hinder successa friend of me li is really a smart man who has critical thinking and seems to be interested in everything in class
for example whether you understand or whether you are distractedteachers will also use notes pictures and simple video to help us understand the content of the class this will make the class more colorful and attractive
it is important to be able to ensure that everybody  s ideas are consider and constructively discussed
finally i think i didn  t study in an efficient way
i really concern about my essay i never do the long essay before especially 1000 words up essay
different teaching ideas now more emphasis on the cultivation of all aspects of knowledge and ability in the first degree is basically the transmission of knowledge
however the ones i attended didnt really leave that much of a lasting impression
i think the most important point of successful collaborative learning is communication
i think i can work on these principles during my taught msc and in my working life
andlike edinburgh and manchester there is no subway
i think the lecture was delivered in a wonderful way
usually in a lecture the lecturer needs some simple gestures to help the audience focus on the content of the lecture
my fellows are so great
be positive brave and also cautious
firsti am going to meet with my group and other classmate in order to debate atheme
the threesemester academic system per academic year may provide us with more opportunities for selfstudy9
when english meet strangers in the road theywill give a smile or greet with each other
now you need to cover a lot of the points youve learned in the article7
and to be honest during this semester we had good relationship with each other and i learn many things form them
after class i will complete myassignment independently and with high quality reading the feedback from ourteacher carefully and correct my mistake in time
of course i can be confident to say our ppt is very logical and structural with background main body and conclusion
under this circumstance it is difficult for me to choose only 2 factors from these materials and sometimes i also may miss the most suitable aspect of my topic because of my bad making decision abilityin conclusion i think those behaviors and habits are main factors prevent me from being a distinction student
some classmates prefer to sit on both edges of our seats and sometimes its difficult for other students who come later access to their seat
i think it is so good for us to understand the lecturer defined
in the past we just listen to our teacher in our university and do not have interaction
it is as same as my premaster classalthough i had attended two semesters ofpreparatory courses in london before i can only say that i was familiar withthe basic style of lectures
effective collaboration will only be achieved if each team member is bringing their unique intuition talents and feedback to the table
fortunately i cut out this bad habits now
in addition keeping a good interaction with the audience such as maintaining eye contact with them which can enhance the engagement of our audience
for example we have class that need to sit in the supervision group our member who get first in class will keep the sits for us
i admire him very much
in addition they always engage with our eyetoeye
the second problem is procrastinationwhen i need to complete a task or a work i seldom consciously look up materials and prepare in advance
is not only focused in get goodmarks also to have a good worklife balance
this is quite novel to me
and i can hear all the lectures clearly
maybe interaction communication solvingproblems leadership and so on are very important
my teacher communicated with me after this exam
everyone of us can hear their voice clearly with the microphone and the slides are clear enough and concise
in general all inductions are very good because it helped in my orientation inside of the university and how amazing the courses will bethe helpful activity was for me when we created a innovative bussiness with small pieces of paper
i think braveactive cogitative and resolute will foster successand timid irresolute will hinder successi dont know their names one of the men always answer questions activelyand discussed with our teachers after classsome of our classmates concentrated on their own work instead of listening carefully
i can not say i have no bad habits but i can say i try hard to change my bad habits like sometimes i was have no motivation to study hard or to reach the destination i was too lazy to do some assignments and some times i was afraid to lose face so i try not to show my opinions in public or show myself in public
i would say that in the past week my motivation has dropped a little this may be to do with christmas coming but hopefully i can regain some of the stamina i need to keep on going until ive finished my assignments
students have different background like someone is good at some knowledge but someone needs to learn the new knowledge
yes to all
this teaching style is completely unfamiliar with our chinese teaching style
in this situation it could be highly unlikely that any work will be done as soon as i hang out with my friends as again this is outside of the university hours
besides when we think about the corporate logo and slogan everyone shares their different ideas and explain its reason
but it also gave me more time to learn to be alonei think its also important to cut down on unnecessary socializing
in big projects there are teams from different countries
i will overcome all of these difficulties inthis year and i hope i am satisfied to myself after i graduate
we can compare the ideas and theories between different environment not just remember them
in the last degree we have all kinds of class competitions such as radio gymnastics competition sports meeting class chorus competition class design competition and so onin some of these class activities we are required to attend10class timein york all our lessons are in the daytime
second i would like to improve my skill in effectivecoordinator in collaborative learning is key this ability
some difficult problems can be solved easily by team work
yesas i said beforeit is surprising that i can improve my generic skill apart from technical skill
using subtitles let me focus on the word and ignore the informationthat speaker want to show
5 in the past i was very afraid to express my views on some issues in front of my classmates
i think this is a very important skill since sometimes i would be hurry to express my own ideas and i may ignore others and they often put forward something creative and that is what i need to learn about
however i hope i could join the next marathon in york if it is possible
teaching style is very interesting this is better than i expected
the content was not very detailed
compared with my undergraduate study we almost trust everything were taught totally5
i also enjoy the collaborative relationship of learning and helping between each group members
essential is recognize our strengths in the team and working as one piece and improve our weaknesses
i enjoyed meeting the other students of amt
first of all the courseware has been uploaded on the internet in advance
but i still have a lot to improve
because i just answered several times sometime i can not understand the words quickly and react immediately
overall the studies and my life experience here has been great
each people have a burnout period and i can not keep my knowledge and skill up to date
first there is the situation that someone is reluctant to do the contribution which happens when he feels it is of little benefit to him
if they dont do that they may meet much more problems than the people who has send bribes
it is not a good way to become a distinction grade student
i have always followed the ethics of the engineering profession during my bachelors as well when i was working
definitely
online
in the past i did not know how to distinguish mynotes and how to review it
the will answer my question patiently and provide detailed answer to my question
secondly the teachers speed and accent can be understood
in the prelanguage course i have learned some methods of taking notes
and other elective courses which were especially interesting such as etiquette course knowing ceramic shell and so on9activitiesin york during this semester we receive emails of various school activities and we can choose to go or not to go voluntarily
i am going to miss theprofessor joanna style of teaching because yesterday professor joanna told usthat this is her last classes in university of york
teachers in china seems more concern about theories and homeworksometimes would be considered as lacking of interaction with students
in all lectures the teacher will showcase some cases and news to give us a better understanding of the course content
i know that we cant copy and learn from eachother when writing assignment but we can use collaborative learning whenreading assignment requirements
i think the lecture management strategy is very clever
i cant use what i have learned very well yet and would be anxious about that
this may have a positive contribution in my future work life
our international business lecturer always provides a reading list for us its very important for us to get better to understand the class
iwas upset to study
besides fear of public speaking is my another weakness although it had been improved a lot in presession course
every single classs task has been assigned and her class was well prepared
i like to record the confusing points and those make me feel are special instead of write everything down which may make me lost from lecturer
i found the other students prefer to think and they are more creative than me
some teachers make the slides very clearly which is really helpful for me to review the knowledge after the class
firstly all group members should have a common goal
because herstyle of teaching is motivational and challenging to me
everyone have own advantages we need to learn with each other rather than just believe one person
first of all when i write academic essay i will learn what should i do and what should not i dofor example i will learn what is academic misconduct including personation plagiarism cheating and so on which is very important for our essay
weather when i was in southampton it always rained but in york the weather is better8
a good group learning atmosphere is the foundation for successful collaborative learning
i know it is one of the most important ethics to put the safety and respect things in the first place all the time
i think the biggest challenge is to respect and protect intellectual property during my taught msc for chinese students do not take ip seriously due to the academic atmosphere in china
to be honest i am not good at taking notes
i learned two things time management and team decision
i think it was a good begin i knew a lot about my major
besides when i search and read the useful sources i normally do not mark the origins and link of articles
therefore the assignment of responsibilities is a very important part of the group work
i think i cani consider that promoting public awareness and understanding of the impact and benefits of engineering achievements and being aware of the issue that engineering and technology raise for society and listening to the aspiration and concerns of others may be challenges for me which means that i should not only grasp professional knowledge but also have ability to communicate with public for passing these knowledge
i should try to face my life and my studies with courage and determinationi think that if i can work toward these goals ill become a wellrounded and versatile student of being bookworm
due to my bad oral english i didnt raise my hand in class
another thing that preventing me from being distinction grade student is emotional instability
in addition to that i have to admit that my english is not very good especially in oral english and writing so i am practising my english everyday by talking to local people reading scholary articles
this happens when the group members dont like or hate the other team mates2
team work has not really commenced in autumn term
in the first degree there is only chinese traditional culture3
therefore before i do presentation i need to be familiar with what i have said before i can express it clearly to othersauxiliary tools such as pptposterword document will show the outline directly to everyone which can help the audience to better understand what i mean and the picture or video can also be a good auxiliary function at a glance
taking notes in class i will note the key terms or rules of the term and then make detailed notes based on ppt after class
very well
when you form a group you will have many different opinions and understanding which will allow us to better understand the course of study and make progress together
i an really interested in spanish and their culture buildings foodetc
it must be mentioned that the academic writing class taught me how to write paper dividing paper into several topic paragraphs and it would be much easier to solve each paragraph
so some basic information i already knew before
but since it has been a long time now i use abbreviations short terms and other ways so that i can follow the lecture as well as take my notes
he is very patient and a litter humorous
because thecombine and the complex of the different can finally result in a amazing andgood idea
i feel confident to ask my doubts knowing that they will get an honest answer
note below the top five skills you want do develop during your year here they can be skills in the generic skills list or others such as improving your english
group work
on the other hand there are lots of thoughts and ideas in a group which is difficult to achieve agreement
but i have heard one of factor lead to unsuccessful her teammates are very good and talent but that is why they dont like each other everyone have the same thought my idea is the best well the collaborative will be broken
noels lecturer is also very interesting he can give us so many examples and suggestions the content is very clearly
although i did not express it clearly i still worked hard to participate in team discussions and decisions
talking about humour i like the lecturer of international business his way most impressed me is the performance for different cultures
in york i usually use harvard referencing style or ieee style
i would not say collaborative learning definitely more efficient than individual learning but by collaborative learning actually can explore your mind and think broader
my favourite way of a class is an interesting interaction compared with the complete theoretical knowledge the way of interaction will appear more attractive can make students more involved in the classroom feelduring this semester i also took part in two positions at the chinese student union at york university
in the msc in em at york we often encounter theneed to participate in the design and production of a project by ourselveswhich broadens our knowledge field8students in york are come from many countries so we can communicate witheach other9
at the same time i also saw that when the teacher raised questions not many students participated in the interaction especially some chinese students which surprised me
when we come to a totally new environment this kind of programme is really important
i do like the supervision group and i can ask some advice from my tutor whenever i need the help and my tutor is really kind to usas for the activities which should be changed i think maybe the social event because the students just communicate with the students who they already familiar with
initially i thought about thisholiday has a long time i should relax first
then i have to learn their movements and sounds to make me look natural
not everyone participate in the group work4
yes i am quite looking forward to unknown challenges
1 i studied many classes about real estate during my first degree but now im studying many lectures about management
being out spoken and direct fosters success as this way the group knows what the team member one speaking has in mind
second i am going to monitor our group project as wholei think one way we can learn more effective is usingcollaborative learning
the lecturers did help me move form one point to the next
dont laugh at others for their shortcomingsfinally i would like to say that one must have a sense of responsibility in order to play a better role in the team
i think that when i cope with the academic work i will maintain a positive attitude and take each lesson seriously
university of york encourages hard work as evident in the ways modules are structured
sometimes we agree or disagree others opinions and may be angry when somebody doesnt understand me
although the speakers are very professional they are too professional for engineering students
because my major in undergraduate is engineering management i could give them some professional basics answers and help them with professional skills
i have been in york for two months and i feel that it is still going well
this is also an essential habit in our future presentations
what i would like to learn from this course is the legal issues that need to be addressed when dealing with multinational companies rather than the details of the uk legal system lectures
in class there are students from different program
creating invention from pictures was perfect way to integrate group
and when we have the class they like to use the examples to make us learn more about topic and led to the next point easily
a person have good logical thing which i can learnin social part it is really help me to cultivate the ability of communication as well as the ability of team working
and i think my skills of doing presentation is poor
after about 5 weeks study here attendingmany lectures
more specific we can learn how to manage time to allocate works as well as to organize a team its strongly linked with our major
when you work in a group you need to attach importance to team performancemany time you need to coordinate all peoples thoughtsand its easy to have conflicts in a teamso we should adjust our emotions to avoid fierce conflictsit is bad for teamworkso we should get along well with team members
maybe there are too many chinese in em program we will try harder to interact with each other in english rather than mother language
the introduction of elog and elearning are important and useful but i suppose the introduction of the library is not very clear and it will be good if have some introduction about schools facilities and some recent relevant activities in school like freshers fair
so i could go to library anytime especially before deadline10
they had different perspective
i think the biggest significance of induction programme is that i learned the framework of the course and how to write references
a different way of speaking in a lecture students can make a statement offhand in lectures
using eyetoeye connection with the audience6
yesmanagement based on engineering programme
everyone have merits the point is how to find and learn2patience
i hope no
this is my shortcoming all the time since when i was a child
second engineering cost does not involve engineering management and engineering management includes engineering cost
i think the reasons why collaborative learning is sometimes unsuccessful are as belows1
on the other hand at classes lecturers always interact with us
i can identify threeweakness in myself
i am surprised the programme which include lots of areas and concern about the final dissertation
they can not be finished by anyone
the teacher stay until the end of the class and not leave time to ask the students if they have any questions
i immediately put down the books in my hand and walked out of the library followed by an afternoon shopping time
i think the information that the lecturers want to talk about depends on what skills the lecturers want to teach us through a module
john is different when he teaches us international business he always makes some interesting games for us to know the topic of this lecture
when i first came here in york i was really nervous regarding my studies but the tutors here have been so great and especially the modules that they taught was really a fun experience
after learning the rae ethical principles i realized the great responsibility of being a future engineer
every question will be answered
as far as i am concerned communication ability and modesty are essential for successful collaborative learning because communication can shard idea from each other and modesty can keep the relation of teammate
we certainly expect to do challenging things in the future with my members because we are confident and working hard for our assignments although we are from different backgrounds different personalities and different customseveryone is confidence and we all would like to learn each other
also in future when i am working in an organisation i would follow my ethics
im sory i dont understand a question
it is a big expense for the average family
and yutong liu is determined to work and always has some unique ideas
he explains the module more in a practical way than a theoretical waylaw really concerned about this module as it has a lot to do in a short period of timeenterprise noel does teach this module a bit fast and maybe rushes a bit through the main points
forthe first time i stood in front of so many people and read english
brainstorm is a useful way to propose some constructive advice
since from the start i feel so much difficulties even i dont know how i can get started things then with time and teaching strategies of york university was amazing how they guide us in a very efficient wayin the start i thought i cant make it right for me because in the start it was looking so much difficult and now after week 5 i am feeling so much positive in getting distinction grades and i start making researches about many thingsthe worst thing i feel in the start was my time management i didnt realize at where i have to spend time so much that makes me in trouble so now with time i get to that point and i got it how i can used my time effectively and which things are really important forthe best strategy which i applied to my daily life was writing things on diary with title things to do on daily basis i write something on night i have to do those things tomorrow and i will start doing in the start that was really cool thing and a best way of using your timeanother great step i choose was using bicycle as in the start i spent my two hours daily for commuting on bus which was a waste of time and then i realize it would be great if i start riding a bicycle and then i found a cycle track which was quite near to university of york so now it takes me only fourteen min to reach at universityanother bad habit which i was is taking decision with reflecting now i am in a situation where if i want to take steps then i start thing about that decision positive and negative aspects and with the force of resilience and i think it will go towards positive side i will start doing that without hesitation and without fear of failureif i got fail then it will be lesson for me of learning so in the future i will take care of those thingsfurthermorein the start i was so nervous how we will work in team and i didnt take any steps in improving it but during enterprise module now i take big step to improve communication between team membersi start sitting in between chinese mates so if they want to talk with each other they should speak englishin a more entertaining wayjust trying to overcome communication barrier between team members and amazing thing it worked now they start communicating and it gives me so much happiness now we have won presentation competition in strategic management class and now we have strong intentions about our enterprise business idea we really want to smash it with good logic and research with great innovative ideamoreoveri start learning writing skill on my own i start reflecting on my previous e log entries what i wroteand how i wrotehow i can make it correct and it helps me a lot in improving my writing skills and still i need a lot of work on it and i am so positive in learning all those skills
if i have anything i dont know i can ask them for help
at that time i just wondered what is law so i choose this module
this is exactly the level i want
in this case i was required to concentrate absolutely in class
but i dont think that my shortcomings are that i have no creativity and no ability to motivate others
i do had some concerns about the new term like culture shock what we are going to learn but after induction i think i have some understanding of how we study
first of all the most important thing is selfconfidence
i think i am easy to be influenced by something about daily life that is so bad
the teachers here will not actively manage the students afterschool life and study
yes as an international student i am looking forward to communicating with students from different countries and cultural backgrounds
i was generally happy with the induction activities while some talks werent particularly engaging with my level of experience i can see how students who are new to the university would benefit from these sessions
i think in the future every group in different lesson should have a person how could not speak chinese
as i said in the former text when a group lack communication tolerance and sense of responsiblity sometimes collaborative learning may be unsuccessfulfor example it is inevitable that there are conflicts when a group does collaborative learning
and the tutors usually used funny stories and experience to explain theories or cases which is useful to attract our attention and it helped us to understand easily
a person who has good academic performance but no other skills can not be called a good student
after class students ask themselves questions that they do not understand2preview
almost every lecturer usually contacted to us by eyes we also gave back our eyes line to express we had been understand the words
the students of my supervision group are friendly and knowledgeable
the teacher provided us with a lot of learning resources to further understand the knowledge points and expand our knowledge
so i will take more time on my reading and analyse rather than entertainmentsin terms of entertaining i am really interested in a serious of sports and the biggest regret was that i missed the marathon this mouth at that time i just arrived at york and everything was fresh for me so i missed the registration time
i remembered a story told by my teacher
this is good because i will demand all my capacityhowever i must improve my weaknesseslike everybody has weaknesses
for example activelyparticipate in meetings contribute their own views and discuss on the basisof moral claims
as far as i am concerned i think the introduction programme is a difficult and complicated subject
that people can understand very well during lecture is the first point nobody likes to hear a lecture with confused and unordered
firstly actively participate in group discussions secondly clear goals and think of more ways as much as possible
in york i need to read materials in advance and sometimes i need to learn about cases3in chinese classes in many cases the teacher will need to understand the things are stated or listed their own understanding after class while the british teacher will only speak out the most important part other expanded knowledge and related basic concepts need to expand their own learning4
i never had a problem with understanding what about speech will be
however i realize that sometimes i spend a lot of time writing things ignoring what the teacher is saying in class so that i need to ask some help from class mates
by careful note taking listening to the lecturer and previewing the material beforehand are all good ways to foster success
and their slides just list some key points which mean the slides are clear enough and concise
these all could prove that i have contacted much knowledge related with engineeringmanagement field and also could present my excellent learning abilityespecially in foreign environment as well
but every teacher is logical and strict
she isengaged in eyestoeyes contact
the main challenge that is present would the language barrier as previously mentioned
i feel that i can abide by these principles
thereful i often listen the video of class after classes and make more notes which is a waste of time to some degree however i can find the key parts and use a red pen for emphasis the key parts
i cant believe that the term is about to end in a few days
i could hear the lecturers clearly enough
the teacher is very polite and always says thank you to the questioner
even though i made the decision to overcome my procrastination many times my procrastination delay dealing with my procrastination
i will add them to tomorrows list with a star so that they do not get rolled over a second dayby the day  s end i will have a rough idea of items i need to do tomorrow
i think the first one is confidenceonce you have confidence you can be a good speaker but i also learn some thing from the lecturers and my recent presentation that you could be confident without practice and wellprepared
all the lecturers have their share of knowledge in the specific subject that they teach
there are a common mistake people will made in collaborative learning
environmental design is about aesthetics including garden designarchitectural design and home decoration
haven t changed my thought yet
the strongest shock i realised is culture
as we know every person has their own habit and working method
well we just have to see their respective experience on the subjects and the amount of years teaching the engineering management course
maybe there are many reasons why collaborative learning unsuccessful for example some member do want to coperate with other members or can not achieve the task until deadline
the learning environment and living environment in the uk are very different from those in china
we need more group work so we need a stronger sense of teamwork
good organizational atmosphere
the premise is that you must catch everyones attention at the beginning of the speech attract their attention and continue to do so
he is a very friendly lecture and his slides will always have many images to follow
in addition how to explain and express your complex opinions and research clearly and simply is very important
pictures are also used in most slides where relevant to help with the explanation and audience engagement
but in uk the teacher wont force us to answer the questions and we can answer it causally the quality of answer wont influence our final gradeeleventh we will not invite social elites into our class in china we just have only one teacher for one course
i extremely like this teaching style and if there are more stories to explain the knowledge it will be better
they repeat the question so that others know what the question is about
in our group they have a lot of interesting ideas and also have strong handson skills
the scope is wide but it is better if we can have more chances of applying the theory in th class to the reality and i hope we can have more changces to talk about something in english in the classes
i like mr noel and dr bidyut s slides
the challenges are likely to be the lure of money
unfortunately i have not prepared this task for the past month i have been playing with my friends all the time
the members of the group are independent individuals and the way of thinking and acting varies greatly depending on factors such as experience and origin
fortunately there are no such people in our group
i think it would be better if teacher could explain a profound knowledge clearly and easily
accommodation is different accommodation in york is one person and one room and in the first degree is eight people living in a dormitory private space will be much less7
always need to change my learning plan to cope with different subjects and teachers so i try to play smart with my learning strategy and all
i think it is necessary for a group to be more efficient
thus i believe that we should have more communication to build up our relationship moreover we should not only limit our communication in study but also have more intersections in life
i will put forward to my own opinions and communicate with them actively
i think as a distinction student they shouldhave the following qualities 1 they have their good habits of study such asdeveloping and implementing a detailed study plan
i can learn by the team not only by myself
3
4i need attend my schools tests at the end of the term but now there are some essays and no tests i think this is a very obvious difference
one suggestion for an activity to be added would be something that could engage with the departments facilities such as the pc labs in order to gain familiarity with those students who are new to the university of york
firstly i would like to lie in which makes me waste alot of time on the bed then i could not sleep early
when i meet the situation i usually stay up late to make up the time i wasted
it was somewhat useful to hear from the university about what is expected from students at the masters level
in order to promote team core competence vector superposition team learning and knowledge sharing must be carried out
most of questions are answered by those students who are not chinese
we should focus all of our attention on the class because we cant replay the class again
in this way they will not be able to grasp the details discussed in the last meeting in subsequent meetings thus affecting the efficiency of learningsecondly it is also important to get along with each other
this team can do things efficiently and do them best
secondly the negative working attitude of some people will increasethe workload of others
in the last degree my courses are data structure complex variable function programming and so on which means we need more practice4collaborative stylein york we have six members in our group and in enterprise we have seven members
according to each weeks lecture i like international business and strategic management best
there are often some people whoactually do the job relative to the course content come to be the lecturers
what  s more i can discuss with my groupmates when i have some questions
i think all the lectures delivered well although the first week i could not understand all the words very well
we need to evaluate critically
the skills to communicate is a critical element the collaborative learning requires the members within the group to engage in the meeting and exchange their minds
time management is critical here and students have to allocatetime appropriately by themselves
in the end i worked hard and i managed to upgrade my teams ideas with my own ideas
these activities gave me an insight on how to work together
i dramatically like this style in course and we could have a great communication together9
if we can not achieve the common goals it is difficult to work togethersecondly i learned to have leadership and actively organize and carry out learning activities and programs
however i think that resiliences ball interaction can be reduced
this induction programme is much easier and more enjoyable than i thought i am very satisfied
therefore i must pay more attention to the skills of learning and communicating with team members cherish the opportunity of team work position my role in the team and make contributions to the team
in the lectures i must concentrate on what the lecturer say
after every lecture i need to do more further study to make sure i can understand the point given by the lecturer
he does not clear up the objectives of lectureprofessornoel jackson defines clearly his lecture
i feel that i am getting on well studying at york this year
both ppt making and speech presentation are very mature
for the course of strategic management for em the lecturer is dr north
previous majors studied programming so they needed a lot of selflearning time after class and they needed to search for relevant videos and book materials from a variety of websites
what surprises me most is that many students are creative and they can always come up with new ideas
i believe i canthe challenges maybe from the communication with my supervision group member but this is a challenge i have to solve
in the previous study all of my studies were so time management is not the most important thing for me but in york the time management teacher has always stressed that i also i have been learning how to manage time8
i think i will use the knowledge of how to make my slides perfecti will pay attention to my speech such aseye contactto be honest i will be nervous when i give a talkthe first thing i use is about how to overcome nervous
yes i have the confidence to work to these principles during my taught msc and in my working life as an engineering manager
since there is not a time table at all i usually do not know which step should be done at what time
except for one course we need to complete and submit it online every week
all of our courses have the special text book and we should follow the instructions of the textbook to study the knowledge
the lecturer always makes sure to say what we were going to discuss in that class and it gives us a brief idea making it really interesting to see the topicsthe presentation slides are clear and precise which makes us aware of the topics to be discussed
in the end i was shy when i was talking to others and wanted to finish the conversation as soon as possible
even if i have a lot of problems preventing me from becoming a grade student
afterwards i reflected on myself and decided that i could not do it again so i will correct my mistakesi have made many wrong decisions and made many mistakes but only mistakes can teach us to grow
the first thing we can improve is our english speaking we need to talk with others with english although sometimes it seems we cant understand each other we can still learn something about how to speak english
it can not be avoided
according to the personality of the group members some can be solved very well while others will cause great contradictions leading to the failure of a cooperation
more opportunity for public speaking
on the other hand they havent a music background and i will be able to help them when they need it
this is because chinese is our native language it allows my partners to understand my ideas more clearly
i found someone play games by their mobile phones which surprised me a lot
after started course the induction week was significantly helpful for my study especially i did not have prelanguage course
for example there are the following points1
they try and cover every slide as possible
at this time we need to discuss together rather than compromise casually and affect the work results of the group
first a good learning atmosphere isimportant for successful collaboration and it is the key to teamwork
this fact
at the same time every lecturer has eye contact with us
it is important to express my own opinion
in the future work i think the most important thing is how to balance the relationship between construction quality and the companys financial interests as an engineer
i can even write an experimental report in the same time
because each persons goals are inconsistent there will be differences in the process of collaboration and it is difficult to convince people who are inconsistent with themselves
if the engineer arbitrarily leaks company secrets or does not work seriously the engineering accidents and so on are very seriousthe most challenging thing at the moment is the ban on chat software during study and work
my last degree was a bachelors degree
i think i take notes in class and from the course texts very welli am always careful in classwhen i encounter the questions i would write down and ask the teachers after class immediatelyi use different colors to divide different contents to help me understand my notes when i review them
as a student how to learn selfdiscipline is necessary but thisproblem needs to be improved
sometimes surfing internet by using telephone in class may hinder success
usually he or she is a selfdetermined and optimistic member to play the role
yes i really expect some specific challenges
i hope all my classmates can be more familiar with each other therefore they can feel free to seat with other new classmates
i prefer seminar
however it may be a bad habit of mine that i always sketch my notes so that my notes may not look very good although they are structured
thus sometime while i am working or studying someone may text me for asking me to attend activities
in this way my oral english training is reduced which is not conducive to the improvement of my english4
i think finishing task on timegaining knowledge actively and communicating with others will foster success and if you have not had you heart in you work will hinder successthere are several students in our class are very active and always respond to teachers questions no matter whether right or wrongit doesnt mean that students who keep silence are unconscious but those active students would feel more confident through exchanging thoughts with teachers
everyone are aspire to be a distinction grade student
i was happy with the induction programme
more less people in the class also is a goodidea
we cooperate better and better
most of our work in china is done in paper form and here is the electronic version3
this will help me adapt to the new environment easier
differences in teaching between first and second degree subject language much fewer classes in the week much fewer courses teaching is more targeted specific practical interesting much fewer students at the course higher quality of education better teaching equipment and facilities a different form of assessment
when i was sleepy i went back to the computer after washing my face
i think i will be the same role as my test the completer to foster a sense of urgency within a team
difficulty and complexity so that with a solid foundation the ability to accept new knowledge is not too bad
then i would preview the knowledge of the next class in advance and exercise my listening level to help me understand the class
i know it is a bad habit but in chinese culture losing face is a very horrible behavior so i try to reduce the impact and to be a more positive opening person
i am going to use collaborative learning in two ways
the team building is really an efficient way to get to know with our new classmates and we really increase our confidence and develope our cooperative sprite in the team work programme
here we try to get in everyones opinion and then move forward
by using this approach i can understand more about the course contents
lecturer does this by outlining the aims and objectives i think they do it well
no cheat
this is betterthan my home university
a good decision will greatly improve work efficiency butgood decision making requires a leader who has a good overall situation
this eyetoeye contact was very effective while imparting knowledge to us because we can concentrate and pay more attention to the topic
they have many thoughts about the task and i think our cooperation is very happy
here basically the lecture is fifty minutes
lol
respect your teammate and try to persuade and discuss with them
because of there are lots of students in the class i am not familiar with them
i am trying to find the bad habit or drawbacks but what the truth is that if someone can find and improve or overcome every bad habit on themselves then everyone could be a successful man
their handson ability is pretty good we can communicate with each other easily and be happy to listen to others ideasbut we are all lack of leadership
maybe i can learn a lot more about english from them
now i have learnt something from the past already
the first thing i learned wasorganizational skills
the modification had little impact in cash flow
by looking at the bullet points in different slides we can visually realize this sentence or word could be the definition or specific terminology then we will try to concentrate on the tutors speech instead of thinking about irrelevant issues
but i certainly improve my english to solve this problem
after coming to york i encountered more extracurricular reading assignments
the induction is very useful
the first one is the body languagesome lecturers do well in body languagewhcih will make people focus on hisher talk
besides i have picked up some easy abbreviation the abbreviation of words short the time for me to take the notes down efficiently
however there still is a problem for me
sure there will be some similarities and differences in the groupbut we need to work on all those things and create a plan that would be better for everyone in the future
i havent been involved in such incidents before so i made a hypothesis
for instance my goal is to be distinctions and i will treat my homework ever time carefully
the first thing is to be confident
in york i need to pay a report so i must study academic writing well
regarding the reputation that the university has with the multicultured events or gatherings it was not up to the par
it can be said that the knowledge acquired in the masters course is really the knowledge that will be used in future work
for example in the past team projects always want toreplace the views of others with their own views this is a behavior that doesnot respect
when i decided to pursue a postgraduate degree in uk my parents especially my mom was very worried am i gon na have culture shock they worried i can not understand the lecturers class and i also worried about the way of teaching is very different between china and uk but when i started the journal studying in uk i was very surprised by the professors they try so hard to teaching our knowledge they want to delivered the lecture to us perfectly they try to use simple words to explain some complicated issue to make us better understandingand they do a lot to make sure we in class mentally and physically like eye contact some jokes to drew our attention or just do some activities i think we have some connected when we in the class
most of the time the teacher is talking
we did not have too much homework to cope with till now but in the future maybe christmas vacation we need to deal with a lot of reports
this is a bad habit of mine as i could manage time well andmake notes for the assignment beforehandanother bad habit is not drafting my assignments this iscrucial as it gives me an idea of what to write instead of diving in to theassignment without any prior research and ideas
for the logical outline i respond this point in the first question that the most easy structure for the presentation is find the information about what why how for the topic
i personally feel that my procrastination is a real cause for my downfall at times because i tend to wake up at the last minute
finally i will use different colours of fluorescent pens to mark some important do not understand and need to query the place so that they can be the first time to pay attention to these
what an amazing thing
i think our lectures are all very good
after induction programme i have the initial plan about my learning such as the direction about my lesso
if we can solve this the challenges will not become problems
however msc in em course doesnt have textbooks we focusing on what lecturers delivered in class and discover more knowledge by ourselves after class
since i have a good english foundation i have achieved the required score in one month of ielts study which gives me confidencemy undergraduate degree is engineering cost which is very similar to my masters degree in engineering management in york
i saw that my roommate is learning to inspire my own initiative
make many new friends than before9
and as a girl i hope that my notebook will be neat
i hope i can get more useful knowledge about this major
basically when i start making records on my laptop firstly i will type the date and the title of the session
teachers showed me what i will meet in the year ahead and introduced their teaching style
this year i may be attending a school basketball club so that i can exercise and make new friends and practice cooking at home
if someone can not get help when he has confusion about some tasks he may feel isolated and give up these tasks
in my undergraduate i passed all the lectures and also won scholarship and joined the student union
the class was well designed and every section has the connection with the next partmanagement and marketing of technology noel and bidyut designed their lecture carefully and they give the content in the very beginning of this course
moreover the social event can help us be familiar with each otherthe most helpful part for the induction programme is the supervision group
stay in kinshasa after design phasemeans you will stay in a foreign country for at least ten month and will seldomhave the chance to step out of the base due to the possibility of civil war
in factdifferent lecturers have different styles
although we cant fully appreciate the style of the mentorthe positive enthusiasm of each mentor makes us motivated to learn
they have the strengths in technical skills but they donnot konw more about the business
the teamwork
i thought that perhaps the academic writing session could have been streamlined a little to reflect the students prior experience during their undergraduate degrees
i can also use some app to do some practices when i return to my dormitoryi have worked for four years
this is the main problem that i cant apply my research skills very well
yes i do
however we had not realized that this is almost equivalent to the formal speech until sarah asked us the present our project in front of all the classmates one by one
sometimes though the focus is super intense and you can come up with better ideas in a very short time
different students learn different ways of listening in class
frequent eye contact can ensure that the audiences are engaged in the presentation and hand gesture can attract the attention of the audiences
i have found that some students actively interact with teachers and are good at expressing their ideas which is very helpful in broadening their knowledge
the uk regards it as privacysolving the difference lies in your own learning habits and the ability to adapt to the new environment
each person has his own study group and needs teamwork tocomplete the assignment
therefore its always take a long time for me to read it
then i will finish our assignmentwith my partner together
the teachers are so kind and my classmates are friendly
this week we started a new module called voice acoustics and applications and we asked helena why the module was starting in week 5 instead of in week 2 as the others did
to be honesti am not very familiar to all members in my teams but i think it is good we are from different educational backgrounds and we have different work experiencesosometimes we have different visions on something or decisions but i think its good because i can know about another filed that i have not touched even though we have different thoughts but we try to ask everyones understandingso we can learn because of the differences
i think the foundation of academic work isthe prestudy and afterschool review of every class as well as remember readthe book list what the teacher asked
in the process of group cooperation there must be many difficulties that are not clear to everyone
and i have the deep understanding of my major via the induction programme
in the last degree we only have one assignment that requires teamwork and we have three team members
the task of the group is to be challenging in order to stimulate the team members ability to cooperate
l do the preparation before the lecture so l pay attention to what lecturer emphasize and the point lecturer wants us to do the further reading
ifsomebody ask me questions about a lecture i could answer 20 per cent of thesequestionin the lastmonth i evaluated myself in order to improve my note taking skill
in china less teacher told about it9the web learning system
i do not need to do homework requiring advanced mathematic knowledge8
for the most chinese studentsthey are not so willing to express and show their opinions during the coursei think the most challenge is languagei think we should have more interaction with tutors and have courage to show ourselves
i want to think that my evidence is partial and my judment will change in the near future
many authors are able to publish books because they like writing
i cant write fast enough to keep up with the teacher and most of the time when im halfway through my notes the teacher has moved on to another topicmost of my notes at that time were incomplete and disorganizedwhats worsethe bad mood caused by the incompletion of notes also affected my efficiency of listening to lecturesthen i changed my strategyin class i spend more time listening to lectures and occasionally taking notes because i think it is more important to understand the class content than to memorizeand after classesi will review the teachers slides and put some missing points on my notes which also deepens my understanding and memory of the class contentusually i will use red pen to record the key points so that i can distinguish them lateri think these points are likely to be the content of the final test so i try to write clear and detailed notes and mark them with different colors which makes it easier for me to understand when i review
i think there is a very good leader in my group and i think he can assign tasks to everyone according to their strengths
in china a tutor takes a class of students and basically answers questions about life and study
but we have to learn to compromise andmake a deadlock if everyone has their own opinions
asking the members of the group for help in case of difficulties to prevent the stuck time of a certain problem form being too long and affect the progress
yesbecause i thought that there was only technical skill
the notes and slides provided have also been clear and well laid out making them easy to read
i think get distinction or not is not vital for me but making friends learning new things and practicing professional skills are significant
i will start learning at a very late time which makes me waste a lot of time
firstshow us how to write good content which include the introductionof presentation  s introduction main body and conclusion
i find that the foreigner students have better innovative awareness than us and they are more willing to have interaction with our lecturers
i have learned a lot about management marketing and law which makes me feel that i have benefited greatly
i think in every lecture tutors always give the content of the class
during these several weeks i have learned some knowledge about law and marketing especially i have got many useful knowledge about the marketing which are very useful and i lack of these knowledge before
i am not an expert in the field but i give my humble opinioni think that there are five factors which influence successful collaborativelearning
of course taking notes is good for mei can know what i learn and what problems i have and i have to solve butsometimes i can not understand my notes when i review them not always
i usually record them separately with different colors which is really helpful for me to review the notes clearly before the test
otherwise you are just wasting your time
i have to say they are good but i still need time to find more about them i don  t think i can know them at all within few days
secondly i can not identify some risks when i do something
besides the leadership in work is not familiar for me because i dont have any work experience
forinstance my team is formed by three countries
they gave us keywords that were helpful to understand
it is a good beginning of my group because i know solving problem needs many different way and this is what my group can provide so theirs idea could solves the problem with more methods thus this also can affect me easier to involve in the team work
for example i have always known this module in the word reference but i have never used it
all the students thought that this was an informal talk between students
as a international student i am very pleased to have this opportunity to take my master course in the university of york
ask questionsprove that these students think about the lecture carefully4
if we ask some questions to lecturers in the class the lecture will answer them carefully and clearly even though after class time
personal effectiveness and masterclasses bidyut designed the slides carefully and new technique will be taught every different class
feel more happy
here is different especially in assignments
lecturers inform at the beginning of the lecture about the scope of of it
start studying before exam
as i know i am an international student i need more practice in english speaking and learning
secondly the language is still achallenge
in the beginning of the term all the students tend to sitting in the middle or back of the classroom so its easy for me and my friends find a good place in front of the classroom
the lecturer prepares lectures or courseware for each lesson
to prepare the notes
first in my group i need to be honest and integrity
but this kind of behaviour is quite formal in the whole society
they encourage me to find more new ways to solve some difficult problems and to achieve my goals
these examples can be more acceptable and easier to be believed by students
that is a nationality difference
in the individual work i saw all information about my assignment in thisterm
and he always ensures that we all understand clearly then he will carry this lecture on
i will find information on the website and collect valid information to develop a good plan to discuss with my team members
for instance the course of strategic management students need use various model to explain what you want to say rather than explain a method we want to use6the teamwork
for the things i am looking forward to it is actually more and more challenges that can make me live more fulfilling and meaningful
if there is no regulations in our society we would come across more unreasonable things
i also create some symbols which can help me to save time when recording and i can understand them after using them for a period of time
since i was a child i have been doing myhomework seriously listening to the teachers requirements eager to become agood student
lecturer always talk funny and carefully then i can have a good interest to listening to them and they always do some funny activities which make the lecture more happy
as for the distinction grade studenti think i aspire to be a distinction grade studentin facti am not sure whether i can be a distinction grade student finallybut i will regard it as my goal during the whole year and i will try my best to achieve this goalin order to achieve this goali plan to do more reading by myself apart from listening the lecture to deepen the understanding of subjects i also want to increase my english skill especially writingsince i think improving writing is also important in finish assignment and improving the quality of academic workwhat  s morei want to improve my critical thinking in my opinionit is important for academic work to have critical thinking and we could not simply accept the knowledge of subjects
we got a good team work
however i found that many teachers ask us to do the presentation to be more brave and presentation even become one part of the final exam in the course of enterprise and international business
we need to learn to share our ideas with others when we have different opinion in a common problembesideswe also need to keep a good relationship with each other to stengthen the teamwork ability
i think that one useful activity would be to introduce each one of the different students to others
apparently none
i was so nervous and i dont think i did this pre very well but during the pre i always remembered what the teacher said in classbody language
someone needs to push me behind me
lectures were all delivered well
after about 4 weeks study in uk i found that most lectures are interesting and the lecturer can hold the lecture easily but actually sometimes i can not find the connection between the content of the lecture and the em program
attending and engaging with all of the lectures will certainly help foster success
so they may choose to contrary to the ethical principles second the challenge will present in the benefit between companieswhen the other sides interests are too big or we do not agree to the conditions proposed by the other companywe may choose to break those principles
i am feeling good to study here
i will ask the teacher after class to ask some knowledge points that i have not understood in class and discuss with the lecturer
undergraduate study has a textbook for each course there is no3the requirements for time management are different
yesthere are different teaching style between my original university and yorkfor example we had more courses that our teachers taught us straightly rather than thinking by ourselves according to teachers guidesecondlythere were less opportunities to check information in library because teacher would give knowledge and answer in our classes but now most teachers would like give us more time to reading documents as more as possiblesoi think it is useful for me in my study and i could receive more learning skills and acknowledges than before
such a bad thing
maybe the parts of me that are preventing to be a distinction grade student are my english skills which fortunately are improving week by week and my maths skills which i have to spend many hours refreshing basic concepts
sometimes i set a timetable but i dont follow it
so when a conflict occurs we should give up some personal persistence for the sake of team harmony
yes，the teaching style is relaxed and teachers pay attention on interaction which is quite different from what i experienced before
from my point of view the management for technology is useful in engineering and the marketing for technology is useful for my future career to promote the products and widen the marketlaw for engineering management to be honest this course is the most difficult part for me
when taking notes i will record as much detail as i can at that time so that i can review and understand them easily in the future
for example somebody might do some unethical things for more profile
but it is interesting because of the course will tell us about the process of technical development
and we usually have some time to do group discussions
in those two years procrastination could more than me
sometimes the atmosphere might be intense if people arguing without emotional control
first i think my english skill improved during the two month studying
when it come to the behaviour fostering successi would like to say that my group memeber have a positive attitude to group taskswe always try our best to analyse problem and think of all kinds of solutions as well as researching themin this wayi believe we can get the success and become the best grouphoweverto some studentsthey may be lazy to group tasks and do not think the assignment in advancebesidesthey do not have their own opinions to one specific problem and only agree with other memebers regardless of what they say is wrong or right
when they are having class notebook is always with them and i can clearly see full of notes
they will also make the lectures more lively and active by playing drama or competition
this course seems more engaging and the amount of workshops and lab sessions means i will feel a lot more involved and stimulated
yes i like their teaching style
thebeginning is always difficult but with brainstorming again and again we havefinally completed the assignment
yesi think one challenge is that promote public sense of the impact and benefits of engineering achievementsits a little bit difficult but i would like to trybecause it needs to think more ways to meet different people group
i hope this couldgoing well but i would find another way if things do not step on the way i expected
1the teaching and learning styles in here help me cultivate critical thinkingbefore i seldom ask why when im reading 2my listening improved a lotbefore i came to uk my listening is poor3learning notetaking skills4i get used to eat breads and pizza i didnt like to eat them before5i get used to rainy daysbecause it seldom rains in the area where i lived in china6
i often think and judge which are the most important questions and review them sometimes
sometimes they listened a little and then continued playing their mobile phone
bad communication will also lead to division or misunderstanding of the team which unsuccessfully collaborative learning happened in the same time
in addition i need to improve and exercise my critical thinking constantly participate in extracurricular activities as much as possible pay attention to current affairs politics actively express my views in group discussions and classroom interactions
starting from energy it gradually talks about the knowledge related to managementhowever i think there is too much thing about the energy about 3 weeks in the class are mainly about the energy in my opinion there should be more knowledge about the management technology or some analysis rather than energy
joanna is energetic and enthusiastic in her lectures and will repeatedlyconfirm in the process whether we understand what she is saying
i think no we have had a lot of induction lessons and the program and the assessment rules are both clear
however i am perturbed about engineering management because i did not acquire the konwledege about the engineering
on one hand everyone is a different individual in a group so when they are doing one subject they will come up with different ideas if they cant reach an agreement it will be an obstacle to get success
thelecturers are all hoping to know more about us
1the way of teaching are differentin my first degreelecturers prefers say all that need to be learnedthey will told us the key points of teststhen if we revise those contents seriously we can pass examsand lecturers dont attach much importance to the interaction with studentswhile yorks lecturers hope students can communicate with themand give them more feedback2now lees time in classstudents have more free timeso we need to manage well our time3the teaching content are differentin yorklecturers prefer give students more chances to show themselveslike more presentations and more plays4yorks lecturers are willing spend time to communicate with you they are very kindnessin the pasti thought my lecturers are seriousi were a little bit afraid of talking to them5my first degree are still used a lot of paper worksnowalmost do everything on the internet6my way of learning form passive to activein yorki have read more relevant materialsso that i can better understand the content teach from lecturersin the pastlecturers would lead us in each lessons7language environment id differentnowi need use english8regional differencesyorks weather is cold and wetand it gets dark earlyso i dont want to go outside and i always thinkits getting latei want to take a breakbut when i see the time it still so early9i became more independentbecause i leaved my comfort zonei have to take good care of myself without parents and friendshelp10in my first degreei didnt want to show myselfbut in yorka different environmentwhen lecturers publish assignments about presentationi want to grasp the opportunities to train myself to be confident
trust and understand each other
the content in the induction is not really surprised for me because i took 4weeks presessional
then i took another one hour for a shower
however i didnt adapt to the lectures very well during the first few experiences
on the contrary laziness lack of responsibility and lack of tolerance will hinder success
i think the current teaching style is fine because the postgraduate course needs selfstudy
however if too many members share the exact same preference this would cause conflict within the group and too many members would try to add input into the same category and would cause ideaswork to overlap
as i mentioned before teaching method is truly different from the way i learned back to undergraduate time
fourth i think it is important to have a goodleader
notes
i am not addicted to it anymore
on the other hand if the members of the group do not unite and help each other it will also make collaborative learning unsuccessful
they can not agree with each other and finally do their own work
at the same timewhile giving help to others we also gained valuable friendship
but when everyone is working together on a common project there will always be differences of opinion
it means the tutor absolutely did relevant and large research and prepared carefully before the class
also eye contact is veryimportant
after the playing i could not stop thinking itsstory
record the ununderstood contents of the class teacher and study after class2record the key analysis of the problem
more and more question that i have to thinking between the class because in my first degree i just listened to carefully during the lecture the teachers would tell us everything what we have to know and it would appear on the exam paper5
when the tasks are divided individually it would allow for every member of the team to work the topic in depth and then pass the knowledge to the team members and viceversa
so in many group meetings our leader doesn  t know what to do andhow to organize our mission that many our meetings last too long while we don  tfinish so much missions
i hope that these activities can be added in order to promote the interaction between the students from different background
its a totally different experience to work with so many people from different walks of life
i learned about the general plan for this years study so that i can plan my time better
the environment is the most different thing4
many of my teammates are talented in creating and the results showed that they all tend to be a good leader
in some course modules there are many important presentations that can be hardly finished by individuals therefore collaborative learning is essential to the study
there maybe a little challenges because of different cultural backgroundsfor examplewe have different opinions in a group assignmentat that time i will first experss my own view and then learn about other fellows thinking and communicate with themfinallyabsorting the fine contentsgetting rid of bab contentsi belive we wil reach consensus
em needs to have the basic ability of project managementdecisionmaking and whole process management
we can share our experience if we have any question we can ask and we have personal teacher to support and help us
for now the induction made the course seem a bit daunting and demands a lot of work but im ready for a challenge
their slides were clearly and easy to understand
sometimes in order to recognise the position for my notes i need copy the information which is in the ppt
as i observed it in the lectures so far the lecturers could solve the problems that raised by the students during the lectures
i think it basically meets my expectations
every lecture we would have group discussion and we can always ask the tutors anything we want to know
i suppose that it is also a bad thing
only recording what the teacher says is the most useful
however the differences is also needed to produce variety of different possible solutions
in this two months in york i think i get very well on everything
actually my team members all come from china and i am a chinese either
for example time management is one of my weakness
because autonomous learning is the premise and important guarantee of active cooperative learning
maybe i should refuse a friends party invitationor go home early but i dont know why my choices make my remaining study timeless and less on sunday and the learning task is getting heavier and heavier
in the group we are study together but atthe same time we will supervise and evaluate each other which enable us to makecontinuous progress3
i would say really difficult and challenge there are 4 different nationalities in my group
on the contrary one of my classmates said that she just want to pass exams and enjoy life so i think that behavior will hinder her success
then i will try to record some key point instead of everything in that case i just need to focus some important necessary knowledge or theory instead of other irrelevant issues
every one need to engage the talk brain storm and assignments5
nevertheless i want to handle it and manage myself efficiently
6some academic knowledge of marketing7some cases offered by tutors
but i can  thear the lecturer clearly in recent two week  s law classes
i think the scopes and specifications of the lectures are very suitable for methe lecturers always give us some example of the difficult problems to let us understand more clearlythese lectures are all useful for us to learn about em
in addition when i saw the assignment of all subjects in this semester i began to make some necessary materials
when i study in primary school i developed the habit of taking notes
based on what i have learned and learned i will use eye contact body language and clear logical ppt presentations to more fully demonstrate what i want to say
5my first degree is civil engineering and it focuses on technologywhile my current major focuses on management
i have analyzed the potential reasons that prevent me to become a distinction grade student
the first point determines that the team efficiency and the decision is correct
i hope that we can participate more in the interaction answer the questions raised by the teacher and have more time to exchange learning experience between classmates
every teachers in uk has the habit of asking questions at end of the course are there any questions
we should never make decisions which will make us feel regret
when people have the same target they can work hard for a same destinations
i think if people can introspectionand summary their own experience in the pass the people will be a really goodstudent in the future
this is because the premaster course i studied at university of york in the last term year which allow me adapt to the current teaching style
there are all chinese people in my team so there is not a big contrast in cultural differences
1 lecturers here are more active compared to my undergrad university2 living in york feels very homely and cozy3 international community at york is very diverse so i have friends from around the world4 learning for masters requires more researching compared to undergrad so i have to start work reasonably early5 less contacts hours means more independent study6 lecturers are easy to contact and are very helpful7timetable is well spaced out so group work can be accommodated easily8 learning environment is very disciplined as everyone in masters aspires to do well and makes an initiative to do group work9 library facilities are also very good10 plenty of societies and events going on so theres something for everyone and less likely to feel lonely or isolated
the teachers here are very willing to answer the questions raised by the students
i feel that although different teachers have different styles of speech and the lectures given are not the samehoweverone thing is that they share a common point they are very confident
in the class lecturers not only make detailed explanations according to one knowledge point but also expand more
also is helpful the fact that we are able to download it before the class have a look at them and also have it in our laptop or ipad during the lecture
i hope work together with different countries classmates
of course i am aspire to be a distinction grade student
i think technology changed our lives quite easier
the lectures started from very basic concepts and continued to the more complex ideas
he structured andanalyzed the key words in a logical way which is easy to understand toillustrate to whole concept of international business
there are three reasons for this
there are a lot of reference books to read before you can finish your homework while studying abroad but in china the exams are all related in one textbook and have a clear scope
this is what i need to correct in the future
obviously is your teammates
i think the different thinking still is a big challenge to the international students i hope that i can know more about different thinking logical
i suppose that even all of us are chinese people but we still should do a management method to force us to discuss in english
groupwork can be supervised by each other to improve efficiency
butto be honest it  s quite exhausting
i am often forced to start my work before deadline
time management
some of them always do the minimum work and even did not finish their task at all
however everyone has their own jobs
but i gradually discovered in fact i am also very gooda lot of my ideas are great i should believe that they can bring contribution to the teamso i should say it out and we discuss together
the common strength is that theyre positive and enthusiastic during the team work the bad sidesi ‘ ve not found yet3all of them have their own strengths that enable our work much easier4
moreover i do feel angry about the certain behaviour of some of my team members
as we all know some theory of management is to difficult to understand so they can give us some simple example to understand the theory
in our group we didnt talk about this part in the first week
course introduction
and making note is also need scientific method such as making notes in heading and bullet points which can help you fast review the key points10 headings and bullet pointsthis is also a very common way of making notes
when we finished the only lecture and come back accommodation i felt so sleepy and idle that i considered these feeling as a signal that i need a relax
some classmates are quite good at speaking english which surprised me mosti hope that i could speak english as fluently as they do in the future because whenever ii want to express my idea i need to think for a while to organize my words i dont want spend much time on it
when i am a member of the group i will actively participate in the discussion express my opinions and opinions and i try my best to complete the task of the groupof course in my opinion most of the students in this world want to be a grade student and i am no exception
this is bad nonproductive behaviour because again academics could be pushed aside in favor of spending time with friends and could be disastrous if this type of behaviour was to persist near examination times of assignment hand in dates
i think the lecturer did very well
really i am happy to meet them because i can learn a lot from them and their culture
the secondary group of people seem to take class seriously but only with laptops in front of them
there were two students from china that i had the pleasure of meeting but one weakness that could come into play would be the language barrier that is present
sometimes the challenges are very difficult
many academic articles magazines and so on will show the research results
people in the group have lofty ideals and high aspirations but ones ability and cleverness can not be given full play
the another situation is that two opposites have totally different ideas towards one thing and both of them dont want to compromise to each other which will influence our process absolutely
i didnt get used to textbooks in york
to be a good engineering manager it is essential to coordinate the whole team
yes i always imagined that the this program will improve my skill in management
i expected to have more interaction earlier in the week with my tutor but otherwise it is as i expected
so my class notes lack coherence and there is no connection between each knowledge point
efficient and reasonable work arrangements
simple tasks have to be done of course but putting difficult tasks behind you is a sign of procrastination
i think lecturers need understand what they want to talk and what they want students to know
frankly speaking all the structure of every lectures were very clear and logic because they all start with easy introduction then they will turn to details and basic key points
because my spoken language is not very good i hope that i can speak fluently and clearly in the speech so that everyone can understand the information i want to convey
some of them are native speakers and other students are all better at english then me
i think supervisors meeting is most useful
taking notes in the class during the lecture is crucial for me
usehumor several proper humor can attract audience  s attention3
at the same time i think the task assignment should be arranged according to the characteristics of each personfourth collaborative learning should focus on reflection summarization and improvement
i expect that it can be improved in the next sessions
i use cornell method to take notes which is beneficial for me to solution and review in our study
on few occasions i could not establish a link with notesmade by me either for understanding or its applicability to solve a problem
i think that the purpose of going to college is not to be a good student but to learn knowledge and apply these techniques to improve human society and life in the future such as when we develop faster computers that can help solve medical research problems or improve the accuracy of weather forecasts to prevent natural disasters
i think they generally start with simple and basic knowledge and step by step to improve the difficulty and depth of the course content for example in the course of law of engineering management the teacher will first introduce the basic legal framework and basic legal content of the uk and then talk about engineering ethics which let us know even if some behaviors are not violated in the legal sense we still need to pay attention to and take seriously the work because at work many projects may have serious consequences because of some unskillful behavior
we dont have tests so i dont write possible questions but even though the assessments are very concrete sometimes the lecturers give ideas or suggestions to have good marks and i use to write them to have them in mind
i have struggled with some of the labs but i think once things click and i improve with my programming abilities i will enjoy it a lot more and obviously this will help with my assignments
and the most important thing i learned and what i haven  t done well yet is eye contact
i believe that after daily getting along with others we can trust each other more
i think our teacher is quite humour for example in the course management and marketing of technology the teacher used a funny picture a pink heels with the patterns of hello kitty
understand
i will try my best to follow these principles
no one can lead learning and everyone have own opinion without take others advice this kind of situation usually cause learning unsuccessful
shuaishuai is another girl in my group except i she is good at operation and some difficult manual operations were depend on heras for me i maybe do well in coordinating everyone during the session and make plan in advancefinally our team gained the top 2 during the session by our efforts and we are very happyof course the most essential thing is teamwork everyone had a same goalvictorywe got it
in fact ensuring the balance between learning and entertainment is one of the most important things in the study abroad life of this year both to get a degree and to have fun
therefore i change the way i take notes i use computer in the class if i want to write down an important point or word
at the same time it also helps to maintain the coordination of work2
meanwhile i think the most challenge for me is to be brave enough to say no to other team workers or not
the ability ofselfcontrol is very important to everybody especially to students
therefore it may make me miss my distinction
the slides are also very clear i can see very clearly
it can happen when the group is not on the same page and they cant decide what they want to do
when i first study here i decided to go through the slides one or two days before the lecture start
sometimes you have to break some rules to keep the projectgoing but i would at least try to follow the principles and consider it as theguide lines of my future workengineering professionals have a duty touphold the highest standards but you have to give in a little bit for theschedule from time to time
if i have not yet clarified my thoughts about the future sometimes i will have no motivation for my studies so i would like to clarify my future developmentconfidence in my academic work i always want to know the accurate answer so when i make an idea that i am not sure i am right or not i dont believe myself other people said their idea maybe i will charge my mind
i learned two techniques to take notes
when students finish asking questions the lecturer responds immediately
some people dont want to engage with others while studying and naturally that means theyre not well suited to collaborative learning
sometimes we did not assign tasks toteam members before we carry out group meetings but they still take theinitiative to do some tasks and share it to each other and improve the tasks in the meeting
there are some parts which prevent me to be adistinction student
i would write down the key point so that next time i read it i would know what is the most important thing
yesi doi think msc will have great development prospects in the next 20 years
in the specification he impacted knowledge with different teaching methods such as the example of modern brands cases study and other methods focus on 4ps 7ps these marketing strategies it is very easy to understandnjs course content is very broad but he can balance the breadth and depth of knowledge very wellprofessor tw talked about the types of english law
in the end when give a talk i must let all audience hear my clearly and have a good interaction with audience
when the group lacks a vision
and i dont know what should we do if they never shown up
in the mechanical design of a fruit juicer made by my undergraduate i have not been able to achieve the principle of knowledge innovation
i may need to think more comprehensively about the problems in my teams work to avoid possible risks
in terms of fostering success many students will read the materials carefully to help understand the content of the class before class
what we can do is to be used to their language and learn more about english
when there are divergences all of the people should try their best to solve problems instead of leaving it happening
i am very lucky that each students in my supervision group is very friendly and enthusiasticthey think about things very seriouslyeveryone has their own shining pointwhen we work together to solve the task everyone can present their own opinions and i enjoy the collision and combination of each members thoughtsi think the most important thing in group work is unity
take notes3
it doesnt surprise me but i think that now i understand the references in a different way that which i had
and i also expected i can have some western female friends in my class but it is unlucky that there are only two female students in this course
she always does the eye contact with us either
every teachers has their own way to be humous in class
i know the harm of addiction togames but i couldn  t control myself
my family or friends noticed me when there were some important things coming which really helped mehowever since i learned in the uk it is so far for them to notice me i begin to put all the things at the deadline which can impact my learning achievement directlysecond its english barrier
by contrast i have not such richactivities on campus in the first degree
everyone will be their integration into the collective to give full play to the role of the individual
in my opinion i think the lecturer prepared the topic based on the knowledge what students need to understand about their course and expand students divergent thinking
firstly the lecturer needs to know the time and topicthen he can arrange his lecture for example how many sliders he wants to makenext step he might choose the materials what he wants to talkpersonally i think the lecture should be attractive clear and filled knowledgein order to be attractive ppt should have some pictures and a clear structure
this is because i have attended many lectures not only my major but also careers and so on2
on the other hand the induction events has changed my perspective about my own learning style and the personality tests that were taken really allowed me to have a insight of what i expect for my future
i live alone now while i lived with my roommates during my undergraduate study which means i need to learn how to live independently2
because when you understand your partner fully you will know the effective way to deal with your partner and understanding can help to eliminate misunderstandings and conflicts
well
i try to correct my bad habits now and i want to getgood grades of all my subjects
the activity about teamwork is the most effective i think
yes it isi think it is a good teaching style to help the students participate in class and interact with teachers
yes one of this will be the final projecti consider this a big challenges because it is our final assessmenti am going to help with planning very well our goal and putting very strict milestones in the project in order to carry out our goal and i am going to controland update and schedule of project also i am doing in paralel other activities inside the project as a team really international business contents is very novelty to mei see that i could apply this course a lot in my job because i am going to work in big projects whe i am going to finish the msc
north has a loud voice and her voice heard full of energy so our students can hear her voice clearly
in addition it is necessary for a good student to finish his work timely and do some extensive research
however from my perspective all things we learn can be used in the assignment or case study that we can practice how to use the models and theories10
for example in the lecture of international business dr john use some humour to make us feel relaxed in the lecture and get the point much easier
i would like to discuss them separatelyinternational business i am a foreigner student and i come from china
also they have at least one hobby or activity for their free time
they also consider about our learning in the class because they will look through everyone
i really like that
lecturers are happy to answer the questions on the other hand they thirst to be askedso far i dont feel any problems about answering questions i am happy about that
this could be as a result of my mood at that time
if ido not preview i will have no goal in class and it is difficult to keep upwith the lecturers teaching pace
the notes shown to the audience are also relatively concise so that the audience can quickly see the entire slide without disturbing the audiences attention
this behaviour can make me quite clear about the question
there is a large amount of homework for us to do is in the supervision group which is more challenging and interesting3
it is the foundationfor us to learn all our professional courses
first there is a lack of communicationbetween the team members
it is true that until now i still cant understand every word that the teacher said while taking notes
from otherperspective i often think that it is important to take note in classes
i extremely aspire to be a distinction grade student and i hope that i can finish work well and in time
first of all i am a student from china
i like bidyut very much because i think his lecture is more interesting and i feel more relax in his class
according to the chronological order the invention development application status and future prospects of the object from one stage to the next stage is just so easy for us to accept
yes i like this stylein china seminar class is more tend to give work to each student and require them complete after class usually give the answer in class and spend more time to explain and solve the question actually it is same here but fewer practice we get now
then when i am listening to tutors these background information can help me to understand deep meanings and give me an overall understandinghowever the truth is every time when i noticed that i should get back to learning and make previous research i still want to spend more time to relax and do something for a funny
however it is impossible for everyone to be successful
for example our perumember know how to use the cad while others can  t use cad very well
all the thing i can say is that i will try my best to work under these principles
every time when they finished the lecture they were ready to answer all the questions from us
if someone never show his own thought or work carelessly his performance will influence the proformance of our team
its other than what ive gone through in my home country
i think a distinction student should be concentrated painstaking and accomplished
time arrangement i used to do what i thought of before but now i will do things according to my own schedule3
in this kind of teaching method the students are taught to be an ideal person but this method neglects that students must have their own thinking skillsbecause the teacher teaches differently the way i read is also changed
when i was in china i also gave guest lectures in universities
the delivery and noise level of every lecturer is very good
everyone in our group is kind and lovelythey are good at being a listenerhoweversometimes they just keep their thoughtsthey bring me different ways of thinking and so do ii think its very important to get everyone involved and dont dare to express yourself
the second is that the teacher is very serious in class
all in all students need to learn more and get more technicalskills for our careerthirdly persistence is the precious quality that weare indispensable in the learning process
is noteasy
before i started the course i didnt know the subject content and the exam method that we studied
then i need to bravely expressmyself and change the anxiety when expressing my opinion to strangers
boys have a high ability in this profession but there is a classmate from a foreign country
thats pretty interesting and we learn more about the different cultures
people with the mentality of “ team players ”
for example whenwe need to learn more about the subject
i hope we can finish all the assignments smoothly in the future
the lecturers have all used a good amount of eye contact as well
additionally the supervisor in the supervision group can give us some advice whenever necessary
do not hesitate just do what you think is right when opportunities coming
because current world is a connected world people are not able to be successful without teamwork
we are also working hard to understand and read to increase our understanding
sometimes i would be distracted and interrupted by other ideas in my mind
what surprise me most is the speedthey adapt to everything like teamwork assignment and the environmentperhaps that  s way people say that the younger you are the more possibilitiesyou have
teamwork needs cooperation and different people have different professional backgrounds
it is a very different studying experience in here
yes this is the style what i expected i am so much impressed because i am from asia and there usually educate us formally just reading books and then attempt exams which are quite easier for us but now we are going to learn something new and incrediblei am looking forward to hear from it soon
can you explain
it is true that being with the team member will really makes me feel relax a little when we have the group presentation together but i will also worry about affecting everyone  s achievements if i make some mistake or i am not performed well
therefore when the inspectors make suggestions to the taskresponsible classmates they may not be accepted
on the other hand i can use english more and more because i have a teammate who can not speck chinese
and have patience with the person asking the question
sometimes they will also introduce the relationship between two points
such as eye contacts with your audience should often be made in that audiences will feel they are cared for by the speaker body languages like confident gestures and happy face are important to getting the message across
to avoid negative consequences i will try my best to get involved into every group meeting and express my personal opinion and try to achieve compromise with others
in addition collaborative learning enhanced my selfreflection by comparing with my group mates
almost every module of the course need to do some presentation everyone has the opportunity to do some public speaking and shows what we have learnt during the course5
it is really helpful
in order to get the distinction i have previewed the course which is difficult for me to catch up such as law
there will always be relatively proactive people in the team members and people who have no intention of learning
therefore you must have your own opinions to facilitate the task
do your homework carefully
surei like this teaching stylethe largescale class teaching can make full use of teaching resourcesand it can give more students a chance to get education
if a studenthas the ability to selfcontrol he can easily prevent the external distractionfor example when he is working he can not be disturbed by anything
and i will stop anything contrary to the principles
by the way i think all the lecturers are very humorous when they are talking in the lecture
for instance i could do a lot of things like reviewing what i learned reading some materials to deep my understanding or preparing for the next lecture
i think it is very helpful for my future postgraduate study
for example the study group is permanent which give us less chances to interact with various students
if we have any question all the professor were willing to answer our question immediately and they were very be patient during that period
the question always come out from my mindsecondly most of student always go inside the classroom as quickly as possible and choose the first few lines
when enough information is consulted and a relatively clear answer can not be given after sufficient discussion the team member is required to ask the teacher for advice
secondly sometimes i couldnot follow the class and i would do something else that may makes me harder tofollow the next class so i decide to try my best to follow the class and recordthe class if it is allowable so that i can review it after class
i usuallytell the chinese members about this problem in chinese instead of tell all themembers in english
commenton which strategies apply to you and why not use any strategies you dontcurrently use
i would say the style now is self appraising6
speaking of the nonproductive behavior the first one come to my mind is that i am a person who is easily influenced by people around me
doing the elog on a regular basis is also helping me reflect more on the things that i am doing
actually i have never use harvard style before i took my study in york
communicating as more as possible will help to solve the problem of cultural differences
there are different attitudes of work time among every groupmates
i reallywant to achieve something and make some change in this postgraduate year makeme adjust the society easily and more employable
i like to take notes in weekly form and the notes from same weeks are sorted together
there are not many class hours but moretime to study after class
in my opinion most students are willing to share their idea and information to others
good english speaking can help me communicate better with my tutor and help me convey my ideas better
when i work i will consider the work whether against the rae ethical principles
it is exactly what i want during the welcome week
for example
i think i can work to these principles but a little hard
so i need to be veryhardworking in study overcome the laze
traveling on weekends
afternoon sessions gave me some information about university life here
the lecturers present had a hands on approach that made myself and the other students feel welcome and a part of the university as a whole
in the past we just have the exam or hand in our report for the final exam
yesthe teachers are very nicefor exampleduring the activities in the induction the teachers encouraged us to think and image
our supervisor gave us some suggestion for our future our plan
it makes working more efficient
carefullyobserve the behaviour of students in your class
and the lastly procrastination its really very serious
the main difference i have noticed is the culture divide between the members of our team
i often say a lot in a lecture but time is not enough
in addition lecturers usually make elaborate ppt or word document in advance and use some short words and pictures to help the audience better understand the class content
career guidance center there is a great job guidance center here which can help me find a job that suits me
because taiwan is relatively small motorcycles can be used in various places and more convenient than buses
time of the class
all members of my team are chinese so there are few difference between us
team work is helpful for me
when i took notes i ever encoutered some problemsfor example when i was taking notes the tutor might have turned to the new content of lecture which made me fail to know the new part of lecturei wanted to improve this problem and i found that i shlould simplify my notesso now i take notes by using key words which can improve the efficiency of note takingsometime i will also print ppt and preview it before having lecturethen when i have lecture i can take notes on slidesas for the organization of my notes i often write headings and subheadings to make my notes look clear
therefore i can not learn how to cooperate with others5
in the search data and design process i directly quoted the online ergonomic furniture size as my furniture size but did not make my own furniture size with indepth research i realized that i did not do my utmost to this design
i was very mediocre in the group meeting that dayand didnt share much useful knowledge which made me feel a little frustratedbecause i was actually a person who wants to stand out
another example is myself i tend totook most of the work myself rather than put my faith in my teammates
the doubts are clarified then and there and they are really helpful
in this way they may getnothing until the homework submission date
it went so fast
however the rest of us never touched any relevant knowledge about engineering or business
im not sure whether this is the interaction that i expected
l think l have cultivated the capability to determine the importance accurately and quickly and l add new key points to the original course notes
i would like to learn more about law forengineering
this year is mybuffer period
my company arranged seven people in kinshasawhich is the capital of the republic of congo because we have completedmost of our job responsibility as design institute
the objectives of each class of management of technology are clearly presented in the form of ppt
at that time there was 5 days off before the test
in my group we are all from china which means we dont have the national culture differences but we are from different provinces and some of them have many working experiences so we still meet the differences
upon completion of the masters degree for standard strict with oneself unconditionally rae i need to complete a mentor program often contrast raes code of ethics make sure you complete the task is in conformity with the requirements and in the midst of everyday little homework is always on the background of rae cases of analytical thinking
like other students iam aspiring to be distinction grade students in engineering management20182019we are eightyseven students in the class andeverybody is aspiring to be distinction grade student
now i clearly know that i am a student
but the conditions were not very good because four students have to live in one small room with bathrooms shared by the whole school
the content of each class is rich which combines the definition of knowledge some example with real cases and sometimes some video related to our class
generally the duration of each lecture is 50 minutes which is different from the length of lecture time in chinese university
in fact i think every teacher has a good teaching experience and has told me everything before i had questions
that  s when i decide to quit take notes when i am do some prereadings
i think it is a big problem and i need to be more motivated and become an active learner
this is a fundamental change of attitude towards learning which may be difficult but i will try my best
so all members of the group should finish their individual work
there will be times when group members might need some help so the best way to get the answer is to your tutor about to get it done
for me the biggest challenge is how to weigh the interests of the family and the interests of the work
in order to prevent this from becoming a problem i would ask in time when i cant fully understand what my group mates are saying
i really like it and i expect we use this kind of teaching methods in other class too
because of the limitation of language it can be quite difficult for our foreigners to produce an outstanding report just like the native english speakers
in a team sometime the members would have argued with each other
and he always does the eye contact with usenterprise noel and bidyut teach this course together and their deliveries are clear and efficient
cooperative learning is an opportunity for me to develop my own independent learning
it can be difficult for some strangers to work together but it is easy for the people who familiar with each other to cooperate
noel jackson is clear with his lecture and flows logically
when we learnt the culture we learnt the hofsteder image and lewis model he asked the group to act as a country and let us know how different cultures behave in dealing with emergencies
i think i can not concentrate on knowledges because i still want to spend some of my spare time on parties omputer games and travels
some of us keep insisting their personal opinion so that was very hard for rest of us to convince them and obtain common opinions
the most important thing in this process is to overcome psychological timidity
in my supervision group we come from different countries and we received different education modes
but i think they consider the availability of products we will sell and the wether there are enough records and resourcesbut i focus on creativity of products
furthermore due to the introverted personality i am poor at communicating with others
10
i have also experienced the situation that i believe that my performance in basic courses is not as good as my own ideal that i can enter the learning state faster than others and that my ability to accept new knowledge is not as strong as others
presentation reportbusiness plan lab project report exercises3
3 there are many practical case studies
various webpages are all about halloween and chinas shopping festivals and a large number of products are discounted
in conclusion i really have a lot of badhabits and behaviors which are going to prevent me from being a distinctiongrade student
i think that a lot of slides or text explanations have no effect and even cause disgusting audiences
after that i changed a lot i never miss the deadline after that 10 off in my result so much and so influenced to my final result during the career
i thing that the teacher can have more communication with students this is a good method to give more suggestion to students
importantly discuss with team mates is necessary
the timetable seems quiet intense which could be a little bit challenging for me
he is the one who answer teachers questions actively in the class
besides there are many activities in class such as personal or group presentation playing drama
the lecturers do not directly tell you too much detail they prefer that students can study the content of the lectures while studying independently
however in law class because of some professional words and tutors speech rate that i couldnt understand very well
i think that everything is important
for the lecturer they know much better than us what we need to focus on and what they don  t need to say in details
the body language should be open and we should not do some impolite behaviours such as clicking fingers pointing fingers hands in pocket or in the back and folded armsadditionally link between each section should be found
although these words are important knowledge points this will cause obstacles for students to read
maybe i should go running with my friends more and enjoy the beautiful city so that i can stay productivethere is also a big problem that when i feel very depressed i will be out of work
but istill do not understand it because i have never learned anything like thatbefore
we did have much interaction inside our groups but i really hope that we can have more discussion and opinion sharing with the professors
the lectures were really well designed and they all followed a path so we can understand everything
instead of relying on teachers and textbooks i try to do more research for my studies
the united group can accomplish the task very well but my group is not doing well
to be honest i am not good at presentation and afraid to speak loudly in the public places
take a break and start learning again
also he demonstrated some preexisting apps related to our module which inspired me
the course is interesting and north always do interaction with us
the lecturer smiles and behaves confidently all the time and during session sometimes the lecturer could use natural humor to attract us and give us the impression of the focus points
from monday to friday the lectures are arranged everyday logically and suitably for the perspective from students
therefore i need to exercise my ability to make decisions refuse to procrastinate and refuse to be lazy
talking about the academic work i think the most important thing is to be honest to your work
being patient is also very important for rome was not built in a day6
additionally i can make my groupmate as an example to encourage myself to make progress if my teammate has a strength i don  t have
sometimes when i write the notes the lectures shifted to other parts
after i got there i might nothave any energy to do exercise
the second problems is i think i dont have enough solid academic training and professional academic ability
and as a team we should automatically remove all the disharmony and injustice
in this term  s group work i take the leading role in the team which makes me under pressure
follow the law2
although the time seems very short it can be done step by step
the lectures are very good and i can hear clearly and they all use notes
however there were another group who really do an perfect job so we didnt get the prize at the last
some european students do well in critical thinking who can reply to the teachers questions immediately and always come up with their own opinions
besides i don t want to make a mistake until we re sure it s right
in this case two of members ofgroup debated about brexit
changing our pattern is not easy task
the correct way to approach this bad habit would be to put the correct time management in place and to schedule such events as meeting my friends away from timesdates i should spend on my academics and treat my social life as a reward after completing work tasks
everyone should show their thoughts to each other in group talking
i want to enhance myself from different perspectives and i will try my best to do it
moreover my procrastination will affect the quality of my homework which is not conducive to my studyive tried to do a timeline but its not binding on me because i still dont do what im supposed to doi am really not good at managing my time
secondly we studied different majors at undergraduate level so there are some differences in how we view thins and how we approach them
personally i found lecture well designed and concise
i saw that it is different than in my country
i hope i can meet more colourful life in the future and earned a distinction degree a year later
in this situation it is super difficult for me to refuse the invitation from my close friends though it may influence the original schedule of my work and study which is really a bad behavior
it now appears that it is undoubted stupid decision and i swear that i will never do similar things in futureup to now i am still dissatisfied because i always be late
in this lecture i have lost my ming many times and i tried hard to concerate on the lecture
the challenges would manifest when i go into the industrial world after my masters
wellthere are different factors for people to success and fail
i think these lectures are designed better
another behaviour is he or she did not listen the words from tutors in class and did not do their homework study is really really really important for us so i hope everyone could gain a great grade when we finish our taught master
after everyone was finished it was the turn of sarah to summarize
i like to take notes by lists because i can easily know how many points i need to focus on
thanks for them
i was pretty appreciated about the experienced lawyers the knowledge taught by them is really practical and useful
i didnt attended the event
in this case it is very important for the team to help each other and find a solution
i can hear the lecturer clearly and have the eye contact
i guess that my academic work is not very good because i can not read documents quickly and analyse on point
and i am happy with the programme
i thoughtgoing to the library to study was a very troublesome thingone sunday afternoon one of the members of our group used wechat toask everyone if they would like to study in the library together
so for thirdconsecutive year i applied to a university to study my master
compaired the formal study way i think i have progressed but sometimes i failed mainly because i could not concentrate on the lecture all the time
i think it is helpful to record the key knowledge that the instructor mentioned in class during the class
the most important factor is communication
however there are still some badhabits with me
noel always puts many pictures in his slides to help us promote our understanding of knowledge
it is necessary to state your opinion clearly and boldly even though there will be disagreement among your group members
i think this is very important
therefore it is necessary for me to find an efficient way to take some pivotal notes
the taching style is almost same with what i have experienced in the past except language and more team work with classmates
i had no prior experience with academic teamwork
collaborativelearning is an important learning skillalthoughmost of my courses are personal work in my major collaborative learning willhelp my learning efficiency to a certain extentfirstlyfind a team member that suits me and respect each other
sometimes project are very sensitive so make sure you have to present real information with practical evidenceas a manager you have responsibility to communicate well with employers and also with your clients so make sure you have enough knowledge and good communication skills to convince your clientsalways try to uptodate your knowledge with new technology and innovation in engineering fields so you can promote new technology impact among the people and also introduce those technology in the business
following the class thinking and thinking about the class taking notes previewing before the class reviewing after the classsleeping in the class do not finish the homework distracting in the class playing cellphone in the classsome student always play their phones in the class maybe they can hardly understand what teacher say but i think they still can watch the slides and try their best to follow the teacher
before i came to england i stand a flag formyself
i hope that i can be brave enough to face all my audience and observe the reaction of what they are saying
i think international students are a bit shyhesitant to talk so communication is definitely a weakness
this gives the chance to have a more personal relationship with the lecturers and hence improves participation in class
time for asking the questions
if i would have to think about a situation contrary to the rae ethical principles i would say when i did my internship at schneider electric during the summer 2017 where i think that the human resources department wasnt honest with me since they told me that i was going to be the same amount of time in every department so i could learn for all of them but it ended up not being like it was promised so i think in that moment the first rae ethical principle wasnt achieved because they werent honest with me
therefore in the following time i should work harder to learn new knowledge and constantly review what i have learned so that i can acquire more knowledge to answer the questions of assignment
this is because at some point team members can not achieve the unification of opinions and do not try to understand each other
sometimes students will drift apart including myself
the tower building session was a great way to introduce everybody and get people closer to their course mates
the teachers physical movements language logic eye contact and the main content of the lecture are all lectureable skills that can be learned
in my own country the school usually does not emphasize the importance of teamwork so i lack experience in working together with the team to finish a work without the team role test in induction week i even dont know the differences from team role
because the six members of the group are different individuals each people has different opinions on the same thing
i remember that my friend and i prepare go to york outlet but we can not find the bus station a friendly lady asked us initiatively weather lost or not and gave us a right road
i have to searching the vocabularies all the time during the lecture
in that moment this kind of spirit will tell people do not give upfinally i think it is complicated to explain how tobecome a qualified student
however there still exist the rest of the classmates who look to be bored in class maybe because of the language or just feeling sleepy
what a pity
for instance in my group we had a meeting about in order to applycollaborative learning
and in my teams i am trying my best to express the ideas listen respectfully to each one and be cooperative with my team members
in addition to my studies i also want to visit more cities and countries during this year to broaden my horizons and increase my knowledge
9 in china there is no homework like elearning
the difference between the course and the assignment is mainly due to the difference in the model of class because the courses here have no scope and everything can be the teaching content and assignment
also sheis very sensible with his audience when she notices that students are tiredshe used the strategy of movement
yes i think i can obey the rules that remind me all the times which can work in these subject like an engineering manager and i would also like to work these principles
however some reasons still exist
when we ask questions in class if they dont hear clearly they will ask again
on the other hand if the presentation contains a large amount of information the speaker can ask the audience to know the content of the presentation in advance
and i almost concentrate on the lectures in all class
i have to say that this simplifies a lot of work and is much easier to learn
because i always do the same things in my work i do not need too much innovation and creativity in my work time
and i like write assignment better because it is stressless
this requires a combination of the personal characteristics of each team member to carry out targeted work arrangements4
yes as the professors said there will be a lot of participation and with dynamic classes
and of course we have problems during the teamwork i think we can integrate better once by once
individual strengths and skills should be acknowledged in the group so each member can provide a different aspect and insight to a certain taskassignment
because a lot of homework is done on a team basis i have to get used to this way to get things done better
that means we can learn more different cultures and learn how to communicate with others
its a really big challenge for me that to study aboard and also need to adapt a new study systemin my undergraduate study i found a lot of different parts from now in you
if the members don  t respect each other for example one member don  tlisten to others  suggestions or pretend to listen to advice without taking anyaction follow the suggestions
teachers in both time period are teaching students by giving lectures but there would be proper guidance or appointed textbooks for each subject when i was a graduate student
for example i major in accounting during my period of undergraduate therefore in the teamwork of the enterprise i am responsible for the finance partadditionally the leader can be the core of the whole group
for example before the postgraduate study i had worked as a cost engineer in a construction engineering company
i remember this presentation is about finance
when we are studying for the subjects teacher usually give us some reading list to help us to finish our research
the major i studied at that time was biomedical engineering
i hope that in the group cooperation i will encounter more challenges in the future
in york most of them are vivid vivid and humorous
yifan and yuxin have good sense of observation because they can detectsmall detail to improve in the video
yes but not too many
the lecturers are very clear and easy to understand
they listen to the teacher carefully and think about the lecture deeply
because they are some assignments i want to use some example inside to support or reject my points
in the class i saw many students taking notes carefully and highlight a lot of key knowledge which is a positive aspect but a negative aspect
as soon as possible study more knowledge about the course next i will active communicate with my team member
and through the course we learn more via the research results and the record of development processlaw for engineering management i have no learn experience of law
sometimes i can be a person who is really inflexible and i do think the quality of creative is really important for our students who major in engineering management
i think that the members of the group activities can not be fixed which is more conducive to us to absorb different knowledge
after i heard about ethics i felt ashamed not to communicate the issues with my leader instead of making concessions
however during the process when i dealt with my academic work i find that there are many personalities and habits prevent my improvement
therefore because my notes are more refined knowledge points it is easier to understand when reviewing
and i do wish the class can be more active so that we can learn the konwledge with higher passion and focused attention
in this case in fact you should go to the lecturer for discussion or ask classmates to study together
last but not least my writing skills need to be improved
point i do the face by myself without telling them
please be assured that the correct time management will be in place for my academics
first of all i  m feeling my improvement in the english language
in my opinion
because i never touched some relevant information about this course before in that case i will try my best to read as many books as i can to improve my skills and professional knowledge
moreover it is easy to arouse the debate and contradiction within the group which seriously affects the harmony of the group and the efficiency of the work3 the team members are not active there is no enthusiasm to learn
overall more boring
so i think every teacher must have a very deep teaching background and experience
every member of our supervision group have different type of the characters
i have never worked with people from so many different religions so to understand what they want to say is of utmost importance as a team whether they agree with the final decision or not and then take the final decision
after four years working i have formed a good habit of taking notes and i think its an very effective way to record remember and summarize important information for the both working and studyingof course because of the barrier of language and different ways of thinkingits a little difficult to obtain the key information and record them on the notebook immediatelymissing the key information and following the teachers s steps of courses are the main difficulties and challengessowe should promote our listening ability and practice obtaining effective and important information quicklywe should use different color pens to mark some different important information notebook in order to make my notebook more clear and easy to review and read
i was disturbing for a long time because of this issue
behavior that will foster success1
then they should think they just need to introduce the latest technology and models or they show something following the historical development sequence
there is also a factor that will affect my learning is lazy
when i take notes i usually like to write down everything first
another point attracted me is that library have never closed which is really a great area for my study and i could reading and writing and do not care time
this year is precious
it is not enough to understand what teachers are trying to express we have to reflect back after thinking
in my first lecture the biggest difficulty in taking notes was the problem of chineseenglish thinking conversion
the third point is to constantly improve the organization and system that is compatible with teamwork
first of all we should listen to othersopinions and not interrupt others when others is speaking
a girl in our group is often absent from meetings because of her boyfriend
so confidence seems to me to be the most important thing
im particularly impressed with the audio signals and psychoacoustics lectures
i am not very surprised by the induction programme and i am happy with the induction programme
the result of this learning is very surprising to me
while the atmosphere is lively the lecturers can also attract the audiences attention and help the audience better understand and remember the class content
further i enjoy each class for example in the lastinternational class we acted about ethical dilemma
the second is communication how to exchange opinions correctly and how to distribute tasks fairly are very important in group cooperationsometimes good communication can promote the feelings of team members so that we can finish the task betterthe sense of responsibility is also very important the success of group cooperation needs everyones joint efforts we should try our best to contribute our own strength and try our best to do the work we are responsible for
it can offer myself few second to prepare for the next part andgive audiences few second to understandfourth
for example i planned to finish week 5 learning log on this friday afternoon
but for our students when we need to do the presentation professor will give us some topics to choose which is really helpful for us to decide the scope and specification of our presentation
if there are some special point that my team mate need to know i will use different color or bold the words
in my supervision group all the team member want to be the distinction grade student therefore in this kind of learning environment promote me more want to be a grade student
a good student will get more respect from others
the lecture is given by bidyut as i have mentioned before we all can hear him clearly and his good habit of highlight the key points in slides helps a lot
actually it is the same with what i thought and i am happy with that
then it would reduce the work efficiencyon the other hand the groups meetings will be opened in the spare time of the team members so there will be many team members who need to do their own private things in many cases and it is difficult to unify the meeting time somehowthe most important point is that our teams cohesiveness and sense of honour are not strong enough which has led some group members to be less enthusiastic and not have a strong sense of participation
when it was my turn i was particularly nervous because i didnt make any preparations for this sudden speech
it can help me improve my skills in some certain fields and i dont want to always stay at a comfortable zone
everyone can put their own problems on the spot and get answers
as i previously mentioned with my undergraduate degree in the electronics department beng in electronic engineering i have experience with a few of the lecturers that presented during induction week
at the same time people need to understand what their strengths and weaknesses are in order to find their most appropriate role as part of the project
before classy would prepare the courseware given by the teacher and make clear the unknown words
to be honest i am really surprised with the education system which has been followed by the university of yorki am from pakistan and we always taught that read book and do exam so now learning environment in university is so much different and amazingself study is better and when you have such cooperative teachers i am really looking forward to get some amazing experience from it
5 more guests in the lectures take law module as an example people working in different area of law firm are invited as guest to give lecture
that is why i expect more challenges to come
they really dont like to share knowledge3
however ihave already realized this problem i would solve this trouble
later i put my phone in my bag to restrain myself
if you are interested can have a look at chrischenshuaiwordpresscombesides there were many problems in our group during the year and the course was completed in the form of a group
however we are weak in teamworkthey can share their thoughts and discuss the differences
yes absoutly
this will be different in the time of unified discussion because some members will read slowly and lead to different work schedules
i need to do everything independently when i was working because i need to solve my colleges problem
there is a highprobability that i can  t complete my todo list as planned i always finish mywork before the deadline it  s a bad study habit
in the johns class he makes a list of the main points and then give the explanation with them
the major change was to get used to the different food left order at the streets and the variety of ethnicity
the division of labor is not clear and different team membersare not clear about their work direction causing ambiguity and even confusionteam decision making
in order to become better i must overcome the fear and shyness and be brave enough to go out and meet more people
active collaborative learning includes building team goals and personal responsibilities
in these slides the lecturers will provide a lot of research evidence and knowledge background
they were very patient to hear to me although my english speaking was not good
i think the first thing i learned from my teacher is how to complete a qualified speech
i think the lecturers defined the theory academic terms involved our major and the relevant cases analysis detailed explanation are they were going to talk about
first the bad performance on the time management
i was happy overall with the induction programme as it gave a great opportunity to get familiar with my supervision group in teambased exercises which will serve as a good precursor to future project workmy way of thinking in regards to engineering management has not changed much as i have always intended on focusing on my studies with a clear goal to work towards but it gave me clarification on how to approach my intentions
first of all i adapted from handwritten notes to take notes with my computer because my handwriting speed is not too fast so that there is no way to efficiently record all the points said by the lecturers and the use of computer notes will be relatively easy to identify there will be no problems such as font blur
logical thinking and critical thinking i should learn from the lecturerthe interaction between audience and lecturer i also should learn
in my opinion im good at coping with the academic
the paper is divided into three parts cue column note taking area and summaries
not good
by this way whenever i review my notebooks i can easily involve again with the desired topic efficiently
but when the lecturer ask a question most of us cant understand very quickly or cant answer it
the teaching style is exactly the same as my expectations
this weeks session introduces the composition of the college and the arrangement of the courses
generally speaking i like thethe study and life in york very muchyork and my domestic undergraduate courses are different1
by the time i have finished all my chores i find myself procrastinating online via youtube or facebook and i am zapped of energy to engage with academic work and leave it until the next day or as soon as i return to my termtime address
and he always does the eye contact with everyone in the classroommanagement and marketing of technology noel is gentle and he has a bit low voice but with the microphone his voice can be heard in the whole class
case study
i believe that everyone have different background before we have some different opinion is in normal
first of all i will learn their relaxed feelings
the truth is always waiting be found if everyone spend all time trying to persuade other people
i think it is both good for our students and the professors10
this is the first step in making a speech
i think that the two cant be evaluated separately in evaluating whether a student is good or not
for example when given a task on thursday i usually deal with it on saturday and everything takes twice as long as i should spend
whether we use a single word or take out a mobile phone as a translator i think they dont mind and even feel that you are listening to them carefully
yes university lecturers have always been open to interaction and dialogue and that still hasnt changed
this time period can do efficient things 80 of things will be easier to distract
in some it will be almost strange
first of all notetaking can improve your concentration in study very well
my concerns may rise when working with others in supervision groups as language barrier may manifest itself
i read communicating across cultures the fourth industrial revolution
they all came to university of york for their own purposes
it is a way of making things easieryes of course i can easily understand my notes because i try to put things in a more organized way so i can easily get access to it and can understand easily
i have to manage my time wisely
the difference in terms of life is that i think my life is more regular now because i need to plan my time every day so that i know when to do what
it is also a difference between working in a group and working by myself
i need to use more spare time to study
every lecture has their characteristic generally speaking i am pretty satisfied about the lectureinternational business the tutor of international business can be really kind and accessible
i must need to respect allthe procedures of the country
i am very glad to learn in york and there are so many kind people
but to my surprise i got the answer in the teachers explanation before i asked the question
so i seldom take notes until then i just take some key words and important information to make sure i can be reminded of them later
but its a little timeconsuming i can not always finish the total notes especially when i participated in the team work
the induction programme was really helpful to know more about the department and the assessment patterns
i have to admit that every ppt we can download from the vle are very clear with visible clearly texts suitable font size neat layout and logically list of key points
i find that english culture has adifference with chinese culture
finally disharmony arises2 not seen all members as a unity
i think the challenges are likely to be some tempation of moneyfriends or famliys request
in the process i could not learn what i was interested in
no there is not
my studyingliving environment hasnt changed much in comparison to my first degree as my first degree was at the university of york
bidyut speak really slow and clear so that i can keep up with him during this course i do like the pace of his teaching
bidyut john and joannawill use their eyes to confirm that every student understands what they aresaying during class
and when i have a more effective method but my groupmates dont agree with me so whether should i give my method up for team harmony or stick to my own idea
these books can help me better understand my professional direction and also give me some good inspiration
without the difficult homework and the stress from parents people willforget what they need to do
making excuses is not the way to be productivetoo
they always have good ideas and inspire us a lot
i think the induction programme has changed my own learning in working as a teami learned a lot knowledge of how to be a team and importance of teamworkeveryone should play a role in teamworkthe strength of a team is greater than that of the individual
however if some team members only participate in the discussion in the meeting but do not contribute their literature what they have found it will steal the work of other members to some extent
the lecturer will logically expand on these headings or very general content
things that oppose all the things mentioned above such as overconfidence absence of excitement and bad attitudes are a good things to avoid
9 international students is easy to know that universityof york is an international one
i am pleasantly surprised that everyone can actively participate in the classroom
i was surprised in the tower programme
thus iwill be objective and truthful with everybody for the rest of my life
the discussion during the class is very effective
i think that strengths and weakness werent approached
finally what doesn  t kill me will make mebetter
for the last four weeks it was all about just filling in the elogs but now with the enterprise module group presentation coming up in week 8 i feel little tightened by the deadlines by collecting relevant information and preparing for the presentation and organising them
although i have found a way to take notes that suits me very well in class i still miss out on something
yeahit is a wonderful subject i like the course and i will spend a unforgettable year
so when i arrived to the city i brought all these thoughts with me
the most important behavior is selfcontrol i think everyone know what is success such as study we all know that work hard and read more books can get high marks in the final exam but computer games movies shopping and some other activities can always attract us away from learning
finally every group should have a detailed division of labour and be clear about the tasks at each stage
most of the students listen carefully in class and actively cooperate with the teacher
they should not only grasp the overall situation but also know the details when needed so as to find out the problems of the team in timeuse team to establish a set of work and management methods of your own project and team
i had study at uk for two years i stillremember my english ability two years ago i can not understand most of thecontent people say and i really can not speak english i felt scared to speak englishto people
i really enjoy group work
at that moment i believe most of the student will be confused about how they reach this conclusion therefore it is worth taking notes to record these question in order to i could have a reference when i want to review these question or if i forget the answer i could ask help for the teacher again
during my two years of working time i felt that working in a company was to use my life to exchange money
and i will try my best to complete each assignment and i will learn new knowledge or knowledge related to the course myself during the extracurricular time
in that way i can do report and project well
the teacher will invite theexperts to give lectures especially the law class there are severalprofessional lawyers to teach us this semester i benefit a lot 7
they have big interdisciplinary knowledge that can be helpful in various situations
but it is still more than i used to experience
i just followed my own idea and there were lots of problems occurred in the end
in my opinion john is the most humorous teacher in my class
as far as i am concerned as an international student i think the biggest difficulty is the language problem
as a student who has already completed his undergraduate study at the university of york doing music technology i find it very interesting how my new course mates approach different topics in different ways
yes i think i will follow these principles in my working life
when everyone encounters any problem communication is the first which can help us to complete the task better
in his class there are so many laughing
by this i can gain lots of achievements in my msc courses
this may be difficult for a student whose native language is not english but i will try to challenge it
we have to spend extra time to make up for the learning time such assleep time
secondly i found that if is a project that i completed independently and i am very proud of it
in the future study i will definitely encounter some difficulties
that is totally the teaching way that i expect as always
this has greatly encouraged me because among chinese students few people have used pens to take notes
their afterschool life is very rich
so chinese documents become my assistantsecondly i can not balance study and entertainment
forth engineering cost needs to learn a lot of knowledge about budget
i will always think critically to think about the problem and listen patiently to the advice of my partner
yes i do believe that i can follow these principles in my study and working life because they are basic requirements for a engineering managerhowever i think that the challenges are likely to be leadership i think the leadership is from experience in work so i need to enhance leadership and communication skills through my future work
i think its easy to understand the key to this course from here
i think that if i dont fully understand myselfothers will be even less able to understand myself
because there are a lot of classmates in the class it is difficult for me to have eye contact with the teacher but i can also see that every teacher is trying to get feedback from the students
because you can see whether they understand what you are talking about
1teachersteaching methods are different
this is the difficulty i will overcome in the days to come
the number and style of lectures is much the same as it was in my undergraduate degree but the number of students in the lectures are very different in my undergraduate degree lectures would have no fewer than thirty students in attendance and often well over a hundred depending on the module whereas all of my lectures for the msc have only ten and the same students in each as there have so far been no elective modules
i helped my friend make a small video before the semester started
this golden rule should be my motto if i want to make the most of my time
visualizations are also important5
the next is the red cycle and black pen
also learn to understand that everyone has strengths and weaknesses
i read premastercourse last year in glasgow i applied major is urban planning at that time ithought it was a partial engineering subjects unfortunately when i went toschool i just know it belongs social science it is partial arts subjectwhich i studied philosophy and european liberal democracy i have not learned thesetwo courses before in my undergraduate period i did not make a good plan and readingliterature sources when preparing papers i did not have a very good timemanagement so that when writing papers my thoughts are messy and in a greathurry cause my final paper score is very low i did not meet the requirement
help my partners as much as possible
and i suppose that the language problem is the main reason but i do not try my best to solve this problem
they all have excellent academic performance which represents alot of effort they have made
as a international student i have the chance to meet students from different countries
the cooperation is very important
it sometimes makes me feel overwhelmed cause there a lotof things to keep tracking ofin the other hand most of the time the professors use humor to deliver the lectures
first in the first degree program six people share a dormitory
there is always a person who declined to express his mind in a group
i can take down something i think significant on my notebook from what lecturers say
when we work in teamswe all have different views on one questionhow to seeking common ground while putting aside differences is a main pointmost chinese students including myself dont like to show their opinionsthats the main difference
only with enough confidence can one have the courage to face all the challenges
we should learn from others strengths to make up for our shortcomings and give play to our strengths
we need to have more patience and conversation
also we are always happy with their jokes and are willing to take part in the activities they ask us to do after the lecture
i am very surprised with programme
if you are strong it will be weak
in the process of team work conflict may happen because of the different habits and methods that team members have
and i found that someone played video game in lecture
there are some people in the class always ask teacher questions and they are good at speaking which makes them more confidence to do that
and we chatted until 5 oclock
i think their experience can help us undersand the knowledge better
this is new for me
besides i think i really need a remediation for my last two weeks courses because i was injured in my right eye in a basketball match and then i was too relaxed to study well
or where are you come from
although sometimes they may not get a reply it is also a way to seek cooperation actively
they are very good at their professional field so that can define knowledge very well and lecturers are all very patient and are willing to answer every question
tacit cooperationeach members complete their own jobsactive atmospherework hardharmonious
maybe i will be afraid that i can not address the engineering skills crisis
therefore we can have a general structure in our mind
additionally lecturers are all willing to have interactions with us and i think they are all approachable
i will try my best to get along well with team members because its the basis of teamworkthen i will try to create an active atmosphere in the group so that everyone are willing to contribute their poweri will put the interests of the team firsti will do my best to lead my team to successinstead of my own success
in this weeks law course i learned a lot of theories especially about ethics
learning professional knowledge and practice make it easier for me to understand the curriculum and how to apply it in my future work
one or two every once in a while is ok but excuses can get out of hand quicklyfor example our group was chosen to give a presentation in strategy lecturewe were so happy to be chosen and i polished my part well
i think the reason why most of the time is unsuccessful is that each persons personality is different
therefore they do not need notes
as astudent we need more selfreflection than passive acceptance of knowledge in theuniversity of york
in york teachers send ppt to students in advance and put recommended articles books or video in vle
i will be more willing to learn in a good atmosphere
will like to imbibe the calmness and simplicity yet far reaching and inspiring of dr baruah in his lecture or presentation delivery
next time we need to decide a best plan in thr short time and give everyone task i am sure ehis will help our team have a better performance in the next teamwork
when the lecturer use some information they also state where they find the evidence which is really convincible
through short moments togetheri found they are all creativethey all had different ideas in the activitybut because they didt draw wellthe good ideas couldt be fully expressed
but msc needs us to image and discuss the strategy of management in the future6in my first course we need to conduct many chemical experiments in labs and write reports while there is no experiments in msc7in my first course students can contact with teachers by phone number or wechat while we can only connect with teachers by emails in msc8in my first course there is rare assignments which need students cooperate with groups because thinking independently is emphasized while we have to cooperate with group members every week in msc9all my classmates in my first course are chinese so we can communicate with others smoothlyin university of york there are many students from different countries so we have to overtake cultural gaps10in my first course all students live in student dormitorythe price of that is 90£per year which is very cheap
the scope of the lectures is still very broad
later i would like to take the key points about difficulties into considerationunfortunately there are some factors that maybe prevent me from being a distinction grade student
actually in these two months i think my life is ok but in the study there are some different between my before school1firstly i think the education method is different
and for trust when you have created trust between you and your partners you can analyse the problem rationally if you have disagreements
the two guest lecturersdidn  t use the microphone while their voice are not loud enough
therefore how to complete the teamwork better is still the problem that we need to overcome now
the language difference is obvious although use english as a way to communicate but accent and language logic will inevitably produce ambiguity on the other hand the work style is different everyone has their own characteristics some people like team work some people like to complete the project independently these differences are regret affect the final resultlanguage factor has very strongly affect our teamwork we spent more time to explain a word which we may misunderstand
however it is difficult for them to achieve thegoal because you must gain a high score in every course
this led to their performance alwaysamazed me and made me realize that my knowledge is lacking
in addition to having an absolute value of cooperation these tasks can be broken down so that each member of the group to participate in the joint everyone has something to do
its better to speak than to regret it at a later time
in my opinion good notes are very helpful for efficient learning which means we can clearly see the structure of knowledge structure and related logic as well as find knowledge points that do not understand
and i obtained many important information which can be used to help our students
everyone has his strengths and weaknesses
i think we will have a specific destination to organize the study and some other activities in group
it is a good way for us to raise interests in this lecture
i know it is a bad habit but sometimes there will be some new work for me to do and they appear more important than reviewing notes
the secondproblem is i found that the content of the lecture is hard to associate withthe em program
in terms of teamwork in the past i always liked to consider my own ideas first
studying abroad
at the beginning of the term i usually have the issue of hearing some of them very well as they seem to talk very fast and of course the accent was not much familiar
the interaction inthe eyes of others is exactly your personal performance so i will start frommyself first spread my positive charm and actively cooperate with partnerson the other hand aspects of mentoringinteraction sometimes also refers to the communication in class which dependson the tutors style and personal acceptance ability
i certainly want to be a distinction grade student of course i need to make a lot of efforts for it
class typethe word accept for the chinese classroom the students always listen to the teacher from customized teaching outline the knowledge you are in a passive active twoway interaction in the uk is get student is the main body we need to consult the knowledge independently compared with the teachers point of view to discuss in class professor or teacher of course is given priority to but this process can make us understand knowledge deepen9
however it is still difficult for me to cope with the articles to be written because when i try to write something i can not combine the materials i find with the requirements of the exam which makes it impossible for me to actually start to do the assignment
keep in mind however that given its durability it is best to have flexible specifications
studying for the first time in uk is challenging in the sense of their environmental and climatic weather condition 5
obviously yes i can clearly know what i should do in the future as well as i can know the specific requirements of the assignment so its very useful for me
i have seen briefly the importance of effective communication and organisation as a group
as i have mentioned before i am so worry about my language in listening and writing
however their strength lies in the obvious fact that one could notice the zeal in them to get better and improve couple with the fact they could be technically minded
i sometimes have argued with others when dealing with problems
surprise is that students of different backgrounds could seek common ground while putting aside differences and get good feedback
in the end i will talk about my own strengths and weakness mainly those that prevent me from being a distinction grade student
the first one when it comes to things related to the interest of the company
i think the modules are scientific and the staff are kind
they are all talkative and thoughtful
another reason some team members personalities are not compatible
thus i will pay attention to the communication skills in this process as well as learn to stand on the perspective of others
besides we help others to solve problems that can  t solve by self
some people have strong leadership some people are good at calculating and some people may be diligent
as itturns out to be time consuming and dictatorial
most lectures tend to have a good structure and a logical flow
isometimes know that there is a need to read but to watch the tv series andthen finish the homework near the job node
to be honest according to the technique from the link below i do learn something from the mindtools website and express my gratitude here to you guys
for time management there are different tools for us to learn to use
it doesn  tmean we were using the wrong information but indeed it would mislead some amateursa good way to attract your potential customer but it  s not something you wouldbe proud of
in these two months of study almost every module need us to do some feedback
i think some of them have similar experience with me
about the difference between my first degree and staging in york i am going to talking in the followingthe first difference is the teaching methods
the knowledge is practical and we can use it into the case study
i think this isa good opportunity to exercise5
i dont know if ill be a distinction student in all the modules but at least ill try to do my best in each of them
i had thought as postgraduate students my lectures wont be more than three times in a week leaving me much time for self study and assignment
after nine weeks of study i have begun to adapt to this
in terms of details it may be easy to reflect the different evaluation views of different people
body languages 2
once the enthusiasm forlearning declines the effect and seriousness of learning will also declinesometimes i came home from the university and the only thing i wanted to do wassleep
when someone doesnt understand concepts in classes others will explain for he or her
it cost me plenty of time but improving my englishsecondly i talk to my group mate that “ please correct my english if you find the mistake ” because there is a britishin my group he always corrected my grammar in my group writing
because there is no textbook however in my former study every course has its own textbook
during this time i find that the lecture system in the uk pays great attention to the annotation and background knowledge of the reference which is totally different from the chinese university
of course all of these lecture could help me to move to the next point
however some logical structure should be considered and discuss together with a team beacause this is the fundation to a project which could lead problem if wrong
and also let me use chiness logic to share my idea
when i was a sophomore i was very busy and had no sense of accomplishment because of similar things
to the test question tutors proposed i write them in the heading of every page on my notebook
i have worked in 2 factories and have learnt a lot about management skills whether they were good or bad
the same is true for law classes and noel jackson classeswhat i dont know is the strategic management course
trust each otheronce we form a group we must learn to trust each other instead of suspecting the ability of others
group work i have much more group work in the msc than that in my first degree6
many people in my master ive seen that dont do anything until another person does it and i think that can hide success
the teachers style of lectures is also different from that in china
this directly affected the lunch on sundaybecausethe party was too late i could not get up on sunday morning
when i review my notes i will see these questions in advance as i can think these questions againwhich can makes a deep impression
another point is that guys sometimes would like to wear just a tshirt during a lower temperature like these days and nobody feel it is strange which means i could wear every clothes that i want and do not care others view
i think all of the induction is useful and i suggest that the induction about the campus might be added
the division of the work based on the different specialty of each other therefore each one in the group in charge of different part
study hard and never give up2
we have not done any group work so far
use some body language
secondly the academic work is based on the professionalintellectual i think this part is the foundation for our study
during the study in em there are a lot of books need us to read on the reading list
to the best of their ability
they made me be more careful and logical4
so when we face the same problem they can deal with it with a different angle
now rent house outside by myself2food before have food in the college now cook myself3learning before have many lectures everyday now only 1 or 2 lectures everyday4free time before few free time
let me tell you a story when i studied in university i select a module named commercial law
maybe it is because i dont like law and this module is always difficult to understand
their answers are very specific and detailed
good work ethic from all group members is a must for successful collaborative learning key skills such as time management are essential in the sense that everyone in the group will have to work at the same standard in the working world
now the reading materials are very abundant so i need to spend a lot of time reading
definitelly yes my thoughts always followed the key of lecture
besides i had also to do the preparation for the lecture i will take on monday
nowadays i have some improvement on the method of note taking
the learning environment at york universityis better than my previous university as it put more money on basic softwareand hardware facilities
before listening the programme ，i really dont know how to write an english academic articlebeside that i also learned how to be more optimistic and how to release the academic pressure
i used to spend more time on learning10more demand for academic writing here
every lecture has qampa time
we have different answers
and he feels bad about studying with others
when working in a group it is important to be able to explain to your partners what your thoughts are on the topic as each idea could bring the whole group closer to success and only through understanding ones thoughts can you combine them with your own to find alternative ways of solving a mutual problem
actually i havent expected any specific challenges
because it makes the job simple and efficient
you should finish the task on time because no one should wait for anyone else
in order to the same target we should put the suitable team memberto the right site
fortunately i am doing a good job during the transition i have successfully made some presentations in the lecture and finished many assignments in time and in good quality
they are helpful and friendly
classroom atmosphere and equipment isbetter8
challenges sometimes are good and will push us to improve ourselves so i dont mind if there are some specific challenges appear in future group work
when i was a undergraduate my major was project costing
besides the division of the work based on the specialty of each other is really important
secondly some courses have reading lists
everyone is very responsible and thinking about this group
they are very serious in each class and always sit in the first row
there were a few incidents where i had to take a decision between what seemed right to me and what didnt
one of my own shortcomings is procrastination which has a great impact on my academic work because almost all learning tasks have deadlines and i have to complete my work within the prescribed time limit
no not yet
the afternoon sessions introduce us about our study and life in york in the coming termsthe activities are also interesting which really help us to brainstorm ideas and we found we can do a better work as a group than individuals
i can remember myassignment and can submit it on time
i feel surprised about the programme that has lots of connection with our job in the futureand i am also worried for the class as i never learn about the law or business before
which part of my is preventing me from being a distinction student
however this style with sufficient interaction can easily make every of us get involved into the class and play more attention to tutors words
this made me see the gap between me and them and the lack of my ability
i have attended the 4weeks english presessional courses where i gain some knowledge about the programme
so i think in my group we should focus on how to avoid absence and laze
in recent law lecture there was a new lecturer invited and we learn a lot from class however they spoke very fast and there are more than 50 slides in one class so it was hard for us to catch upi take notes every class but not every thing
i have no preference about any types of team roles because i think all of them are important and crucial
but for the programme i already fully know about the programme before i came here so everything in my expectations
i dont manage my time regularly
it means i should import my communication ability3then assignment is more than before i should spend more time on my assignment4next time management become important because there are more free time than before i should used my free time reasonably5selflearning also become necessary because lectures knowledge is not easy to understand and extra knowledge become necessary6lab frequency become more also is a difference more and more knowledge are needed to study in practice
their respect each other and work togetherweaknesses are they need to more creative and accept different advice
i must engage myself to challenge myselfi cope with the academic work for several methods
by doing this you can achieve distinguish grade in the end
the peace of york gave me a great sense of securityafter i decided to come to york to study i first began to study ielts
the international business lectures show evidencebackground knowledge on the topics that are taught by showing references to the materials used such as the lewis model and works from geert hofstede regarding cultural dimensionswith other modules such as law for engineering management the lawyers who present their topics well evidenced as being a lawyer is their line of work
everyone has to put forward their own opinions which will help the team develop
because of this bad behavior sometimes i can not digest the whole knowledge on the day
i think collaborative learning is quite useful because this method can gather so many different opinions and ideasin the next term our group also use this method in other modules
theteaching style here is much more interactive than the style i used to experience4
for example the red color is the most important and homework the black pen marks normal content
every time i wake up in the morning on the weekend i will think about how many pages i am going to read today
if im still introversion it will have a bad effect of my work and life
i look forward to more interactive or example presentations
he did not usehumor in his lectures
all in all our group is quite good everybody is very nice and kind we help each other
though if there are any concerns a minor one might be keeping up with the pace of the lectures as there are a lot of contact hours
but i think this is an important factor for success
my styles are tw and co with a creative skill
except sensor and instrumentation i can hear all lecturers clearly
personally i will try my best to fit in this new teaching models and education system
as a student who has come across the world to study for a masters degree it is necessary to earn a distinction degree but it seems difficult to achieve
i want to go further as far as possible on the road of learning
the courses here are what i want to learn
so in some group talks as a leader i often point out the problems directly that may make my groupmates feel a bit uncomfortable and embarrassed
yes i was amazed positively about the induction activities as it was loaded with informative talks and also reassuring of success in ones pursuit
when the work between the other team mates are not divided individually
finally i suggest that there could be more kinds of food instead of only pizzas
the communication skill is the key factor
the type of course are lectures so i have to focus on every word from teacher
i and my friends sometime may ask questions after class they all answered very well
i prefer using pens and paper at lecture because i can write it fast
my notes are mainly taken in english with the key questions marked or explained in chinese which really make my notes easy to summarize and review
law for engineering managementi could not hear the lecturer clearly during the week two because we had lecture in the central hall which is too big to hear clearlythe slides were clearsometimes the lecture failed to engage with my eyetoeye very muchmarketing of technologyi could hear the lecturer clearly and the slides were also clearthe lecture always engaged with my eyetoeye very muchmanagement of technoloyi could hear the lecturer clearly and the slides were also clearsometimes the lecture failed to engage with my eyetoeye very muchinternational businessi could hear the lecturer clearly and the slides were also clearthe lecture always engaged with my eyetoeye very muchenterprisei could hear the lecturer clearly and the slides were also clearthe lecture always engaged with my eyetoeye very muchstrategy managementi could hear the lecturer clearly and the slides were also clearthe lecture always engaged with my eyetoeye very muchmsc personal effectiveness and masterclassesi could hear the lecturer clearly and the slides were also clearthe lecture always engaged with my eyetoeye very much
after using different color marks i find itimproves my study efficiency
so does our international business lecturer who always make fun of himself when he notice we are distracted
in china studentsare more likely to complete homework and pass the exams at the universitysince coming to york university in august i have been treated with rigorousattitudes in the face of academic work
more knowledge sources can be obtained through the internet and people can talk with each other through the internet
older students may create their applicable specifications
there are some people who have different culture backgrounds with me
distracted by all kinds of things every day staying in the comfort circle living a life of recurring which suddenly makes me forget the reason why i choose to come here
look at this and look at it
therefore i search some videos in youtube about how to managing time
the study and life here is relatively easy only about ten hours of the week
for the arrangement of everydays task and lectures we have energy to finish them efficiently
i also know my english is not good so sometimes i am difficult
i tried very hard to manage my time but the uncertainty of theexperiment really didnt guarantee good time management
it is alright if they have consensus
in the working life when i focus on some engineering product i should promote public awareness and understanding of the impact andbenefits of this product
one is ask in the class but sometimes i feel shysecond i will use email
reasonable work allocation can assure every person in group can play their strengths possibly
at the same time we will have a comprehensive understanding of the law of engineering management in the uk
but here is mainly to learn management knowledge and enterprise knowledge
during our enterprise project we need to come up with business ideas this process encouraged every team members to give their personal opinions
these small details happened quite often in all subjects i  ll just takeinternational business class as an example
i know this bad habit is fairlynot good but sometimes i could not control myself
the last thing that preventing me from being distinction grade student is collaboration with team members
whatever the case may be be sure to create an environment where all students are accountable not just a few
second the task is too difficult completely beyond the scope of their knowledge they unable to complete the task in a short period of time third the team members are not harmonious so they can not effectively discuss finding the key obstacles and finding a solution
using time management plan actually is a wonderful way to monitor ourself
i was so happy to enter the induction programmes because it introduced me the course contents critical thinkings and even some writing skills which helped me adapt to future courses in advance
normally they will start make a concise introduction about the definition of one terminology then they will divided into several parts to talk about more details with different situations
the main point is that everyone lacks trust in each other which makes the work difficult
feel more confident10
in fact i think im a collective person which means i prefer to join some collective activities and programs where i can get great satisfaction and recognition
in conclusion my nonproductive behaviours and bad habits are showed in these four points
but after learning about the teaching plan i think i should strengthen my management of time and balance my life
and the teaching method is different
how do you tag your text or takenotes
so i try to focus on the main point in order to take notes in time
the notes can not be complete at first and my notes are difficult to recognise the meaning since it missed some part of the sentences
im glad to be a member of the group with them
after two minutes i was still sleepyi tried to understand that there are a lot of time management courses now which can make a big change to our time management and completely change our thinking
they must work hard they may not know in this period they should do more and more to pass the module
he workload will increase which im sure it will when deadlines for assessments get closer
they have most times demonstrated high level professionalism in teaching and knowledge impacting
how theybehave or how they think
being active and involved is necessary to be a successful student
i think advance preparation will foster success and idleness will hinder successfor examplemy classmate successfully campaigned for course representative because he prepared his speech in advance
we should know each other as more as possible
a preliminary understanding of the uks workplace which can help me prepare early for job hunting after graduation 6
on that website i can see theintroduction of that theory some other picture and a introduction video
i think i have to do more communication with classmate in the future
moreover too much consideration in making decision could be my another drawback
that is really important for us
according to what i have seen i found that before many classes the teacher could let us read some cases in advance or consult some relevant materials to facilitate our understanding of the content of the lectures， such as mmt
now i can control myselfvery well and my selfcontrol has been greatly improved
but in york in addition to listening to the teacher you also need to do some practical work with the students3
he teaches us by slides from powerpoint
communication skills are essential for usgroup work
i think it may be the lack of trust and tolerance
besides the powerpoint slides tutors directly told us what were we going to learn at the start of class and used a true or funny story to obtain our attentions then start to make the structural teaching process
for example when we choose our business we have 4 members sharetheir ideas and we combine renting bike business sharing bike business andebike selling business together into the sharing e bike business
and i have recognised where is my problem maybe in the future i should finish my homework first and leave myself enough time to check and revise homework to get a better grade
foster success 1
an excellent team must be a team that can learn and a team that loves learningthe second is communication ability which is obviously the most basic and important ability as playerthe 3rd kind is executive ability learned communicated well the executive power that the most important ishow to cooperate effectively within the team to complete the task how to spend less energy and less time to achieve the desired resultsexecution is actually the embodiment of team cohesion
after a month of getting along with students in my major there are a variety of people in our major but most of them are chinese although i am also chinese
sometimes when i need a video to support my opinion the video can not be too long
what is more it is more practical instead of only theoretical
yes but it would be better we have more outside activity to improve classmates connection
i think the main differences are thoughts and time
it seems unwise that you spare your attention to take notes
preparing times before i give a talk5
every time the students raised any question or suggestion the teacher would show a happy expression which indicated that the teacher was willing to let the students actively participate in the class discussion and each teacher would explain the question or give comments in detail until the students understood and accepted
i think that for successful collaborative learning mutual understanding and taking the best of each other the spirit of collaboration is crucial
my previous major is only nine students and all are boys but this years professional i have more than 80 students and then men and women are more averages so feel more in the atmosphere of the class6 the teachers requirements for subject assignments are not the same
overall the behaviour of the students does not surprise me as the behaviours are nearly identical to students from my previous study at an undergraduate level
communication is clear between peopleeveryone understands the problem and is on the same pagehave the right tools to solve the problem
mostof the course for me are novelty
for example theyhelped me to check out the wrong of c code
i do not think this is a good phenomenon we have to communicate with each other
getting distinction grade when i graduate from my postgraduateeducation
through the performance of different groups that how to deal with emergency meetings in different countries we learned that people with different nationalities and different cultural backgrounds are different
when we exchange and share knowledge we will bring out the advantages of collaborative learning
i will be wholehearted while studying and be involved in the beautiful scenery fully while traveling
it helps me to figure out some learning issues
because it can help usto improve the confidence and langue express ability 6
so very much excited to be a part of department of electronics engineering
the introductions to course specifics were very interesting however and it was great getting to know my new coursemates
so after i came to britain i always wanted to improve my speaking
the essential factors for successful collaborative learning are mutual understanding and the same goal
and collaborative learning will make our group stronger
when i am in a very bad situation when i face bad habits and unproductive activities i lose motivation and lose confidence in continuing to struggle
i believe that a variety of teaching styles are the charm of western education
my group have 5 people but i have just seen two of them they are very outgoing helpful and active
because learning is to gain knowledge not to learn how to be lazy
this is incredible to know new cultures new approaches newpoints of view
in the group discussion i also lacked the spirit of teamwork
this news was very sad tome
i do most timesunderstand my notes
moreover we need some aimor goal in order to put in practice collaborative learning
about taking notes in class in fact i rarely take notes by hand in class anymore because i am now accustomed to using the laptop as a recording tool
i learned the sense of innovation and leadership from my team members
communicates with lecturers and classmates frequently4
secondly my team members will negotiate together to establish team rules and assign personal tasks and regularly assess individual task completion and redistribution tasks
i think i can work to these principles during my taught msc and in my working life
from my observations of classes students i have not seen anything that i find particularly surprising
this has been achieved by giving us an overview of the course schedule during the first lecture and during each individual lecture by summarising that particular lectures contents at its beginning and end
in certain ways yes in others no
when it comes to nonproductive behaviour the most common situation in college is that when students don  t understand something some people prefer to try to solve the problem by themselves and finally waste a lot of time
yes the oneyear study period is very short but the task is very heavy
i can still remember the case study tonyward brings us it is a complicated law case analysis and our team did lots ofdigging in the archive
the settings of slides were clear and concise enough to express the main content without being tedious
therefore it can be called a challenge for me
because i am not confident in my spoken english
unsuccessful collaborative learning should blame on several factorsfirstly a lack of cohesion of the environment can be blamed
for me language communication is on the one hand on the other hand some people have already participated in the work so some ideas can not be unified
because good communication is a big factor in getting things done quickly
important task need plan b in case something wrong happens9
as expected our class has a huge variety of profiles and as a consequence also has different points of views
i think collaborative learning is the processto optimize my own ideaopinion
i observed students have a lot of creative ideation
as i learn more and more and the gradual understanding of western culture i also feel the significance of critical thinking
i am happy with the team activities，it is a good chance for us to know our group membersyesi learned how to write academic article through programme
of course there are cases where the audience can not clearly see every word on the slide due to the lectures large classroom lighting problems and so on but this rarely happens
finally there is another question
there are also research processes and steps in market research
for example in the law course the professor will show us some common business cases that allow us to understand the characteristics of english law and its differences from chinese law
to cope with the academic work i usually have a rigorous attitude but because of that i sometimes hesitate when i do some academic work not knowing how to decide what is the most important issue
i do like the pace of bidyuts class he has a slow but loud voice and he use the microphone either so everyone in the class can hear him
this is useful because it sets out immediately which concepts i need to understand by the end of the lecture
the greatest part is heoften make some jokes not in the bad way to demonstrate the inevitablefrictions happened in transcultural business situation
at the very beginning of the life in the university of york to be honest i am not really adapted to the new environment
teamwork can solve more difficult and complex pieces of work3
it help me save some time
i can learn more and more skill and improve myself
compared with me they are pretty creative and we have different type of characters
it will bring you some new ideas
he seldom uses the slides he would like to use the word to list some key points by notes
i have attended some similar courses during my undergraduate program
i feel very embarrassed i can only read according to ppt and even worse i dare not have eye contact with my classmates as it would intensify the sense of nervous and cause my brain to be blank
i have a very serious procrastination
the effect of each lecture is very good and the lecturer can be clearly heard anywhere in the classroom
they helped me know more about our city school my teachers and classmates
i believe i don  t need to address theimportance of the feedback from our teacher
cooperation can deal with any challenge
before giving a lecture teachers will ask us to read some relevant materials some cases books video etc through which we can learn more about our subject
also he is a well organized lecturer he can concentrate our attention in the whole lecture
be responsible to group
the worst thing about the group work is that some people cant listen to the opinions of others
therefore i should listen to classes carefully from lecturers and do much reading after class
so i decided not only to memorize some key words in the future class but also to remember some examplesthis way may help me understand and review better
professor jhon issitt often flowsa logically but sometimes not
but in doing so i developed a sense of teamwork and interpersonal skills
good ideas can be shared and ones that arent good can be worked on by communicationbeing quietshy hinders success as good ideas can go unnoticed if no one spoke
firstly some students feel sleepy in class but once they finish class they become energetic immediately
i think that the students in my supervisory group have their own advantages
i have few hobbies and dont know how to relax when im tired
i relation to the differences in the learning style between my previous degree and york i think that the main change has been the difference between lectures and labs
after arriving in the university of york i found the teacher will not tell you the standard answer it is totally different from china
we talk a lot but the main idea is contained in the sentence we usually dont show that directly we have to do that to test the response and analyse our own benefit then make the balance between the partners and ourselves in the final target5th in our group at the beginning of this term induction we all share the final goal in our master study year
meanwhile i will use this ethical principle statement as a guide to my work
i can know many different useful things about the department and my major by this week
i think ittakes courage so in order to encourage myself to bravely break my comfortzone i bought myself a pair of shoes as a reward
i always sitting in the front of the classroom so i can hear them very clearly
in this atmosphere my learning efficiency has improved a lot
however after i came to york university teamwork is an important skill not only a skill required by my major engineering management but also a way to learn from others
my parents have taken care of me in my life but in york i not only need to pay attention to my study but i also need to learn to take care of myself4 my previous study was to go to class and write my own homework
thanks to the induction course before the formal course to help us understand the outline of engineering management
in my bachelor degree six people from one major live in one accommodation six people can have many communications and become true friends
a useful site for technical contacts is linkedin we suggest but do not insist that you create a linkedin account and request a link with your supervisor and your supervision group members as a start to building a future personal technical networkenter on the form below the url of your linkedin profile or your favorite social media site note we will not contact you via facebook twitter or any other social media site unless you specifically invite us
but personally i think the above simple structure is easy to understand so i always insist
based on what you did during the induction session and any socializing in the evenings what can you say about the other students in your supervision group
most of them is accessible but some of them can hardly to understand what they are talking about
before every lecture we all have been informed of the reading list as well as the specific chapter
this has happened in my group but i think we are fixing it with timeanother behaviour is the proactiv
i have a high probability not finished the things what reserved in advanced
they will be very patient to answer for us and try to express clearly
4there are also more group workingcollaborative learning than before
less discussion
i feel lack of selfcontrol is the factor which is preventing me from being a distinction grade student
in the group work i need to do the following three points
lack of carefu
i should strength them and make a great progress step by step
some courses such as enterprise need teamwork to complete the team and most courses need to read a lot of literature to complete the final essay and from the second week start making specific timelines to complete each task step by step
the biggest difference is the language
i can hear the lecturer clearly in most lecturesbecause many lecturers use the microphone to help us hear them clearly
second i can learn the talking style from them
in the past i always had one textbook
and maybe in the future after a long period of time i study aboard i will miss my family
in the future i must be brave to let other people know what i thought
in my opinion poor coordination oftime inefficient communication unclear or unevenly assigned tasks andunsuccessful conversation skills are all possible reasons for failure
i think that i am a person with a strong sense of responsibility so procrastination in me and the sense of responsibility are mutually constrained
everyone has different ideas
i know i should learn by english and avoid mother tongue but i am really confused the law system between china and uk
this stage of my life is aninteresting combination between research and execution
but to be honest i still have a certain gap withexcellent students
so verbal communication is a big challenge for me
besides it is a excellent opportunity for everyone to practice how to collaborate with others and how to define your role in a group
in my leisure time i can go tocomplex shopping mall ktv eating delicious food very easily and it is usuallystill very crowded at 9 or 10 oclock outside however the shops here wouldaround 6 oclock and it will be dark before 4 oclock in winter so i almoststay at home every night so that i can take more time to study
slides were clear and impressive and lecturers were willing to interact with students but sometimes i can not understand very well because sometimes i can not follow the speed of lecturers
yesbut i think in the real situation sometimes might force you to break the principleswe try our best to do it
a fluency and coherent lecture could bring a fresh feeling during a presentationso if i need to prepare a presentation i will make a cool slide and practice a lot
these are very important because i may get along with different people in my future work
its staffs are very well prepared and its lecturers put in practice thething that they teach
team work is important and i gained much from collaborative learning
i didnt do very well in the last part of the note because i will be more relaxed when i do this part so the quality of this part is not high
therefore when the teacher assigned the reading assignment i would finish it several times each time for dozens of pages of reading
have an optimistic and positive attitude towards lifehider success1
most people are quite confident at speaking
at the end of the lecture or before starting the lecture usually all the lecturer will leave couple of minutes to let students ask some questions
however problems would be produced in the process of doing engineering assignment communication between classmate is the second important thing because some different ideas of others may help you to find solution on the other hand some problems are not only happened on your study but also on your classmate communication also can remind others these problems
if we can not do this the challenges will be problems
by em
carefully observe the behaviour of students in your class
and some teachers like to use some phrases to show their views and they will explain their points in the class with many examples
i have ever used my personal idea to prove my viewpoint without academic evidence when writing essay i think which is contrary to rae ethical principlesaccuracy and rigour
the lecturers usually present and deliver the lecture in the most simple way approach
i knowthat changing these habits is not easy but i always need to remind myself
when a group start to achieve an assighment together the first thing needed to be is task assignment which can save time and energy
i think so yes
multiple charges are been pin pointed in that caseboth in common law and criminal law
actually i have observed my classmates for 3 weeks
i think i have made some progress in taking notes
learning can not onlyenhance and inspire peoples intelligence but also stimulate peoplesinnovative thinking apply their talents to lead the team in continuouslearning and fully mobilize everyones enthusiasm in the work
i need to use some technique in order that they canspeak more in our meeting
i think most lecturesdelivery is very clearon the lecturers slide there are a lot of specific definition of the key words and conceptionthey can show us what they want to talk about comprehensively
lecture audio signals amp psychoacoustics is structured very well in my opinion
during the induction my group is extremely unity and creativity
i oftenuse so many machines such as computers and other resources to improve myabilities
however in some situation my teammate can  t express his idea he might subconsciously speak chinese
in york i learned ways to implement
whenever i need to find some relevant information i cant find the information i want quickly and accurately
it gave me a clear module what we will learn in the next year and more details about the courses we will learn
finally it is the first time for me to live and study in a western country
yorkis a very safety place this is very important
8previously my course grade was determined by class attendance homework and exams but in york the final grade of most courses is entirely determined by how well you write your paper9in terms of class size the number of students in my class now is almost twice as large as the number of students in the previous class
i was very confused and angry because the task is not too difficult and i have undertake the most difficult part
what did you expect
i dont think it is a wise act
i have observed other students in the class carrying out this behavioura behaviour that i feel would hinder success would be not appropriately balancing academic and social commitments
when i am coping with the academic work i want to keep a rigorous attitude all the time
as i wish we are not only the teammates but also the friends3the sense of duty for team tasks
it is not easy for me to match with others
i felt very disappointed and sad at the time
because we have more opportunity to do presentation or communicate withour lecturer8
if the group can not work together their performance will not be good
the task scoring criteria are veryspecific implemented to each small scoring point5
this nonproductive behaviour could be rectified by devising a schedule for my off hours away from the university of yorkanother situation where it could be a struggle to engage with academic work is when i have friends over from either university or from outside of academics
the arrangement of the course is also more compact than our country
every lecturer has slides that state comprehensive knowledge of our course and list significant point
law for engineering managementsometimes i cant see the evidence of research and background knowledge in the lecturemarketing of technologythere are many case studies in the lecturemanagement of technoloythere some datas for evidence of research in the lectureinternational businessthere are many background knowledges in the lectureenterprisestrategy managementthere is enough background knowledge to support the subject
sometime there may be a plan to study or review something idleness would make me delay or break my plan and the result is losing more time in order to catch the program even falling behind with other students
the way of the course is differenceswe have textbook for my last degree 2 language is difference 3 we need to read some materials before lecture now 4 professor just give us direction we need to learn more by ourselves after class 5 there are so many opportunities to presentation 6 we need to team work 7 we have more interaction with professor 8
strengths full of passion daring to come up with different ideas
for example when we organize team meeting some of us used to be late to attend the meeting and we have to repeat every key points which we have talked before to these team members
in conclusion i like to graduate in good standing and be the best i can be after the completion of the course
these afternoon sessions are very useful that told me that the importance of team work and creative thinking
becausei have never considered such bad mood could be so contagious and serious
for example when we decide to choose our business  smission and vision a chinese member and peru member have the similar suggestionbut they don  t communicate well and cost us a lot of time to argue about thatfinally we found that we waste to much time on arguing nothing
they graduated from different department in their first degree so that combined the different knowledge and used in our team work
i cant concentrate on completing the task all at once which makes my efficiency very lowi am a person who is very afraid of difficulties
as my mentioned in the last answer i am confident that i have a great method for taking notes during my study life these years
the professors i meet in the university of york are emphasis on critical thing
of course there is also a few students just keep quiet and enjoy their lecture without any response to neither lecturers or classmates
if so they will answer question then move to the next point
besides the slides made by the lecture and their delivery will be good resources to draw on
there aremany factors in the unsuccessful collaborative learning
no book for each course only slides by vle9
thereforehis way of explaining things are quite amazinghe tries that students will be able to recall and use what we teach by helping them engage their prior knowledge and connect new information to their prior understanding in somehow so it a effective way of learning
yesi am
because these people have abilities to solve problems independently rather disturb others
with this way of improving and getting to know each other is now complementing us to work towards a common academic goal since we are gaining better understanding about each and everyone in the group
they often look around the class and sometimes ask someone with eye contactsome of them use notes which is the handout for us
in order to fix that i have changed my reviewing method from read my notes to check my notes and videos together
it could slow down the pace of work or not being able to achieve results if there are lots of differences in our orientation
there are many eye contact and interactions with us
i think the lecture is very effective
which means i will have to think about a new way to take notes during lectures
if everyone refuses to communicate and understand with each other and they even just believe their own opinion there is no doubt that the outcome of collaborative learning is unsuccessful
it is hard to tell which part is preventing me from being a distinction student
finally the content in ppt include specific points examples and summary which are easily be understood by us
besides the third one is all the people have the same goal in the collaboration
when teachers are grouped if these factors can be taken into account it will make the force between the groups uneven and the competition unfair
the team are often able to inspire unbelievable potential group the total collective collaboration of the results do tend to be more than individual performance
also let usdeepen each others understanding
this is not a good habit
we will succeed
because there are so many people in every lecture you cant communicate with everyone
i learn that i should keep confidence when giving a presentation including speaking loudly keeping eye contact with audience smiling as well as using body language
the induction programme didnt have many surprises for me because i had participated in some graduate induction programs at york university last year so i generally know more about york universityi am very happy to be able to attend the induction programme because i can see the classmates and teachers who will attend the class together in advance including my future team members and the supervisor
2
for me i think we need to have a good communication in team work
i have been here in the uk for one year so i am used to this teaching style
i think this is also a kind of evidencewhen the tutor gave us a definition they gave the reference at the end of the definition
in order to let us betterunderstand cultural differences we will imitate the way we speak and behaveand the assignments let us present the culture we have learned in the form of asitcom
the second is to establish a common team goal
after class i always need to listen the record again and do some notes to maker i have understand all information of the lectures
i dont want to make the same mistake twice
compared with them i found that there still a lotof things i can make progress
york city centre is not very big but its leisure atmosphere is good for relaxing myself
am i study engineering management
my skill of reading and writing is a little poor
i found that is really a good thing for our classmates surrounding in strong study environments
the modules are very well designed and as i knew last week there are few changes this year and redesigned modules
when disagreement happens the first thing you should do is to listen to your group members patiently not argue with them
the answer is so clear you or your teammate dont take the responsibility and communication with your team
when it comes to culture and personality he always uses a very humorous way to help us understand clearly and let us know the influence of cultural background on the individual intuitively
regular meetings
so i realized that i have to conquer all my bad habits and nonproductive behaviors
i do like the interaction part with the teachers during the learning period in university of york it can raise our interests in learning and deep our comprehensive of knowledge
besides there are many classmates have a great communication with teachers
i think it would prove that you have already prepared very well
one student said hed like to build a biogas tank to complete the cycle
besides some of my studying habits are really poor
maybe i will gradually get used to her teachingmethod or she might change a little bit god knows
sometimes members don  t talk to one another at all and some only talk to criticize other group members hard work and effort
then idecided to write down the main ideas before the lecture
because he only mentions the general title inhis lecture
if i have been a situation like my boss want me to do a high profit work which is against the ethical principle
moreover the peopleinvolved it is easy to link their ideas with the new ideas
after this experience i usually prepare my tasks in advance and practice many times which will make me full of confidence
i think critical thinking is the most important the lecturers have mentioned it many times during the presessional programme and the main course
but it is a good place to enjoy yourself the ancient city quiteenvironment it is really a luxury experience walking on the stoney road alongthe river without thinking anythingthe second reason i think is the heavyassignments
however at present professional teachers and students have excellent interpersonal skills can easily and naturally communicate with people
got to class on timeunlike now arriving early in order to get more sleep
however everyone major in the different subject there will be some idea without feasibility
besides the previous students shared the experience is pretty useful because they can solve our problem from the perspective of students
my answer is i will do my best to persist it
that being said while its a bit tiring so far its alright
my course of first degree is chemical project and technology so there are lots of difference between these two course1there were more assignment related to mathematics in my first course compared with msc which only need math in finance2there were lots of theories and formulas which need to be recited and manipulated within homework and test in my first course while msc doesnt need that3the time of two course is different i have tp spend 4 years to acquire my first course in china while msc requires 1 year4the language i have to use for speaking and writing is different in my first course i can use my mother language while i have to use english for msc5the subjects in my first course focus on convergence of thinking because questions and problems need to be solved by digging on one point very deeply
during process of meetings some gossips sometimestake extra time and they can  t concentrate themselves to tasks
in the process of teaching the teacher gave some examples that everyone is familiar with
last but not least i have a bad studying habit of carelessness i often make mistakes in spelling grammar and ignore the required formata
and i usually spend more time after class to reread the reading materials and review the ppt3
they sometime use the notes to helpthem do the lecture but usually they don  t use that
this kind of teaching mode requires more concentration of your personal attention4
i think there are many factors which are essentialfor successful collaborative learning
since my program do not have any student
education is different in the way that the uk cultivates comprehensive ability and the uk is more inclined to learn knowledge
using my own word to explain the difficult definition，giving example to make my presentation that can be understand easier and more clearsecondly，i should organize my structure and content making my audience can follow me
my jung typology test is estj
we cant get through 24 hours a day
in this way i have to review the slides of the lecture or ask my classmates to complete my notes
for example in law for em i can not concentrate on the whole class
when i see someone violate the principles i will also stop him
personally speaking it will be excellent to be distinction grade student but if not it is also ok for me
everyone wants to read each persons report give their opinions and help to modify the problems in the paper
for example at marketing management lecture bidyut always gives us the introduction and outline about todays lecture at first
we dont have more selflearning rights
the most of evidence of research is reference and some reading list
i think i will be honest and candid to tell my team members where the problem lies and indicate where they need improvement and they also humbly accept their opinions and suggestions
some problems are difficult to understand and hope can be simplified
each member has different knowledge and different ideas in the discussion
yesit is flexible and i am happy but maybe no change
i need to convert the deeprooted oriental thinking method and think in a western way
during the process of his class he always tells jokes and makes us laugh therefore the atmosphere in the classroom is really active
i find it very interesting how each one of us comes from a different background and their strengths and weaknesses together with their overall way of thinking can vary significantly
however i think this is both a challenge and an experience for international students and i should adapt to this environmentas i have reflected on the last twoquestions
yes，it is
yes in my college graduation design process i chose furniture design
it gives me more tense i need focus on studying everyday carefullycompared with my beng course in electronic engineering1
now much free time everyday5library before dont have so many computers for students
if you donot communicate with others you will never success
in this class we have learned several models to know more about different cultures such as hofsteder model and lewis modelmanagement and marketing of technology i have learned some knowledge about the marketing since the period of my undergraduate
i found someone was absent and always late which also surprised me
i mean in order to know the backgrounds of all the people around
most of the lectures are been deliveredin a good way the idea is crystal clear their voice is loud and clear andthey are definitely fully prepared for the lecture
our lecturers are very careful to understand our questions and make explanations and they are also very attentive to our ideas although sometimes we fail to understand the assignment requirements
it makes me feel different from my former classmates
ze the enthusiasm of everyone is the most critical issue
as a group if we can reach a same thought and then work together the result could always be better
as a graduate student every class needs to be studied
meanwhile we also added reference after pem class
after that i need to cook for myself and do some washing for myself
rich facial expressions and body language changing tone of voice eye contact clear logical order and organizational structure clear purpose of presentation
i think the other students in my supervision group are very nicewe are all from china and dont have cultural differencesbut i think we should speak english to each other which can help us practice spoken englishi guess having a common goal is the most essential factor for successful collaborative learning
at the start of the master course it is really hard to follow the course because of the different language and i need to record the lecture and review after class in order to understand the meaning of the class
nobody will tell you what specific content you should read it just depends on yourself3
i have to change this situation and improve my speaking
in my opinion the first thing i can do is to respect the cultural differences when i get along with my teammates
i am very pleasedthe deepest impression of that class is that we must be fully prepared before every public speaking no one is born with the ability to delivery a speech many people even have the fear of public speaking but good preparation and constant practice can overcome these inner fears
besides that he also uses some interestingpresentation mistake example to tell us what shouldn  t do during the presentationand this is the humor part
i feel that my ability to take notes in class is bad which may be caused by the lack of writing habits for a long time
everyone plays a different role in the group
this is a good teacherstudent interaction experience for me
this action is contrary to the honesty and integrity principle
i didnt get a good grade in the year when i took the exam so i didnt have many choices when choosing a school
i was studying electronic engineering when i was undergraduate so that i dont have management background and the setting of our course includes law enterprise international business and some other useful business courses which can help beginners easily get started
york universitys library is open 24 hours a day and is divided into discussion areas and selfstudy areas
maybe different way of thinking from students in my class surprise me in a large degree
cooperation and enthusiasm
i hope every student focus on the class listening what teacher say watching the slides and taking notes
division of labor is not clear
i think i can fit well with my group and cooperate with them
i will put more energy into study work harderand try my best to get rid of my bad habits and be a better person
however in the uk the purpose is to study more efficiently but some students are also distracted
i need to be more active whether its in the classroom or in a group discussion
all the students in my group are chinese and we had never got involved in such a supervision group in our undergraduate coursesto be a member of our groupi need to think about my peers but not only myself when facing challengesi will try my best to finish my own work and cheer everyone up
to be honest north is really humourous and she always wish us laugh in the class and it is easy to follow her instruction to move from one point to the next
i think the most challenges principle is being aware of the issues that engineering and technology raise for society and listen to the aspirations and concerns of others
for example recently my group is working for our business plan which will be present in week 8 amp 9
every step is very clear the logic is very strong the whole process from shallow to deep we can easily keep up with the teachers rhythm and it is easy to understand
maybe because i didnt get a good rest the day before or maybe because what the teacher said in class was so boring that i couldnt concentrate
my group has two foreigner people i think they will help me to improve my english and may i can improve their english
i almost devoted myself into this competition and enjoy the teamwork process
they can talk frequently and we 4 may be a little confused sometimes because we may not understand their speaking language due to their accent
it is a very hard process
therefore this level of interaction is what i expected and i wish more interesting interaction could be joined in the future classes
according to smith and macgregor 1992 collaborative learning is an approach to keep students in a group to encourage to explore or apply what the teachers present in a course
in china most exams are conducted in the form of examination papers
what surprises you
most of the chinese students are not willing to answer the questions or share the opinions on the lectures including me
maybe i also need to know more about the engineering industry which is essential to look for a good job in the futute
by understanding we can try different lifestyles which is a different experience for us
i have never studiedthis course before
as an overseas student language is one ofthe biggest obstacles we face compared to native students
the teacher and lecturers here dismiss every class in time and never waste the time to check the attendance of all the students10
on the other hand i have experienced collaborative learning when sitting with several of them in the labs trying to understand some code or overcome some common difficulty
teaching style
i hope that the explanation in the reference section can be more detailed
his examples are easy for us to understandprofessor tws pronunciation is very clear but previous classes were in the central hall the sound became a little bit unclear and echoed
its good for us to take part in and help us focus and concentrate in class
at the same time in the identification and evaluation i did not try to quantify the risk as much as possible and prevent it from happening
maybe it because his age is more close to us and he knows how to get our attention
i will need to be sensible withmy behavior because i would not like to affect my team members
also the current professional direction is to be an engineer or an entrepreneur mainly involved in a variety of projects related to the management of appropriate and so on3 the intensity of the course is different
finally i sacrificed my sleep time to finish my homework it brought the bad influence to my health and my next week studying
its a more engaging and student friendly style
therefore there are already some background information in some subject
it also has plenty of examples which will help students to understand what the lecture is talking about
if both things are badly affected it is better to do only one thing
sometimes i will put something off because of an excuse acting like it can wait and brush a task off as not a big deal
for english learning i think my weakness now is that i may not have enough courage to make a presentation with confidence
this greatly improves the efficiency of learning and the workload of each team member is greatly reduced
the next is the language， because our group usually uses english to communicate but each persons english level is different the ability to express and accept is different so sometimes some words understanding is not very good
they were patient enough to answer my questions and they explained the answer specifically
living abroad alone is another big challenge for me
for our modules we dont have examines in this term only the assignments
teachers will emphasize and explain some questions in class in which there are usually some questions
it is through the talk that learning occurs
when i become an engineer in the future i think i will always follow the principles
i just prepared some of the simplest things because time was not enough
dr north usually brings her subject by caseanalysis which is quite common here but the problem is i rarely gets feedbackfrom her especially the homework she posts
i am not quite sure if this violates the ethical principles
in my home country there is an equivalent of rae and the engineering council known as nigerian society of engineers nse and council for the regulation of engineering coren
yesof coursethere are lots of challenges but i think the most important one is that it is hard for the engineers to find a balance point between technology and environment
i have not experienced team works in my previous study life
so we can understand the true meaning afterthe collaborative learning
the slides are quite similar in all the modules except andys which are totally different and all the key concepts are well structured and clear
the first is how to conduct academic teamwork
on this plan sufficient time should be set aside for preclass and afterclass review so that the task can be completed completely
and many students also have a good habit of taking notes it is worth learning
here i have joined many interesting clubs to enrich my afterschool life
don  t write down too many words ina page of ppt
howeverfrom collaborative learning the most important thing i gain is cooperation
therefore i should make adequate preparation before attending the lecture
my other problem is that when reviewing and previewing the content is not deep enough
it also improves the logic of the lecture
but now all of these again coming back in my life i feel nervous as well as excited to face them all again
when someone is talking others have to listen carefully and show respect5
they will develop from the curriculum in the courseware and notes enriching the ideas they need to convey as much as possible
i mean they can understand my questions and explain it to me in a word i can get the answer that i want
i will try to lead my team if i know exactly how to complete the challenge otherwise i will do everything possible to help my team
first of all a group should have a good atmosphere and help and understand each other， this will make members feel that its a pleasure not a burden to work together in groups to solve tasks
once i encounter a topic that i am not familiar with or that i am not interested in my consciousness will be greatly reduced
not applicable
it is a huge challenge tome even all students whose mother language isn  t english
there are many differences between my last formal education and msc in em now i would list 101 the previous lesson was biased towards technology and the current curriculum is biased towards management2 previous studies have paid more attention to memorizing knowledge and now more express my own views3 the previous assessment method is the exam now the paper。4 in my first degree it was more about individual study but now teamwork is also important。5 postgraduate study requires more energy and time than undergraduate study6 undergraduate study has more experimental classes than now7 undergraduate study is more difficult than graduate content8 there are more entertainment avtivities in my undergraduate study9 york university pays more attention to student feedback and selfreflection10 engineering management pays more attention to the allround development of students
the reasons why i came to university of york are broadening my horizon and improve myself
i think it is a good occasion for us to show our opinion and learn from different people
i think it will be very interesting and challenging i look forward to learning more about the subject
in addition i not only learned the technical theory of the mind but also carried out the theoretical practice of this knowledge and verified the learned knowledge through experiments
during the course of the lecture the teacher asked us many times “ can you understand ” the teacher  s logic is also very strong during the lecture
international business during this lecture i felt a lot of difference between the usual class while the teacher always using word and simple ppt to explain what we gon na do in the futuremanagement and marketing of technology clear and classify definition law for engineering management different speakers bring different stylesmsc personal effectiveness and masterclasses each lesson has a clear understanding of what the class wants to explain and additional homework to help understandstrategy management for em the lecturer style from the company is interesting then she likes to use different tasks to let us understand the business strategy
the reception of newknowledge in the collaborative learning process is an important processtherefore it is an important factor to study hard and spend time learning newknowledge in the process of receiving new knowledge
and if we fail it it will affect the final graduation grade
the lecture keeps eyecontact with us and the voice is suitable as well as the speed
in class the teacher would write the knowledge points he wanted to talk on the blackboard and the content he prepared was also written in the notebook
moreover the induction programme do change my thinking about my major
when i went to start my first class in the uk university it very hard to understand each word and ideas from teacher because my immature english level in order to know the main idea of lecture i just read the side by myself to try to find the key point and study
they have a great sense of responsibility as a teacherlaw for engineering management the course is really special and every class we will have different teacher to teach us
the guidance here means reference such as a teacher or a reference book
i think my teammates are all enthusiastic and friendly we talked about our bachelor degrees and our hobbies
when i give a speech the audience is very large and strange so i will be very nervous and uncontrollable shaking which will cause me to forget my words and so on affecting the quality of my speechafter this weeks personal effectiveness and masterclass module workshop i learned that when making a ppt i should pay attention to not showing too much text on each slide
in the process i will respect my team member works and give some helpswhen they need
professor bbs words are very simple and his course is one of the courses i understand well
but i have to point out that a great team should be consists of all kinds of people
my study life at york university is very different fromthat of my undergraduate degree
i am lucky to finish my 4 week presessional programme so i have familiar with something to some degree
i do spend time on applying myself to study however for the reason that it is absolutely the first time for me to write an essay in english
sometimes i ask the lectures some questions by email which are also ansewed quickly
exercise and increase your stress resistance and physical fitness
first of all i am not afraid to encounter challenges because after all there are cultural differences and ideological differences in the same group of members
they answer the questions specifically and ensure students understand totally
finally i hope that i can become an outstanding team leader lead everyone to complete the team task and also harvest the sincere friendship
to deal with the group working we can share our own ideas
one area i have previously struggled is with my maths knowledge
to be honest i take my academic tasks very seriously
regarding the studies it is a totally different method that they implement in the university
our bridge shape is hard to achieve in that time limit but in our team everybody in fully achieving in each secondi think we have done this very well especially the smile on the face of the orange
first of all i think i need toget rid of the procrastination problem which means i need to better managementmy study time and get the most efficiency
however education practice of chinese graduate students is more5
additionally i change the method of taking notes
it was so difficult
yesteachers are more active
to be honest there are a lot of powerpoint during classes so i dont need take notes and i just need pay more attention to what the teacher said and explanation about one concept or one skill
that was something that we are pretty good at at the moment but it is key to us working well as a team and could help our individual study goals
and it can make me keep the focus on lectures
in the future of learning we have to insist to have the discussion and using everyones wisdom to solve problems together
as a result maybe i have done some academic misconduct like missing a cited reference unintentionally2
in some classes teacher will give us more examples to understand and even for the law we can have the presentation from professional lawyers
we used to use books in class but now we use computers
therefore i can only obtain my academic materials through google scholar and some more formal websites
we were given various activities during our first few weeks
during the presessional course one day the teacher sarah arranged a presentation assignment which is about the part of technical review of the long report we wrote
ovidsaid although patience and persistence is a painful thing but it can gradually bring you good
if you are an engineer your duty is telling your boss the disadvantage of your products
if i have the opportunity to teach in future i will use their someof her style in my classesbefore i have started my classes i was anxiousbecause i wanted to see the style of teaching that professors use in thisuniversity
it was a very positive overview about what is comming in this next months
behaviour will foster success1 take notes in classat least proving the student listening to the teachers lecture2
for me the biggest stumbling block to making such an ambitious goal is probably my confusion
first relaxwhen giving a speech the emotions of the speaker greatly influence the audience so it is important to keep a relaxed moodsecond interactionsometimes asking the audience a question can make them think by themselves and activate the atmosphere of the speechfinally appropriate humor can keep people from feeling bored
we can hear what our tutors speak clearly in every lecture
the problems we encounter are more likely to be exposed so as to be solved timely and help speed up the progress of the taskthe same document will be modified and adjusted many times resulting in many versions and may be written by multiple people scattered around which is not the latest tracking the version update is also difficultuse document aggregation of the same name to help you outyou can find lists of documents aggregated as documents of the same name in documents projectdocuments teamdocuments and so onat the end of the project star important documentslater search by filtering star and check the same name document aggregation can be quickly foundall documents in the project are integrated in the document which is convenient for members to fetch backup storage and unified managementmanagers should be able to keep track of their subordinates work at any time
moreover i also find that i may misunderstand the meaning of my notes if i don  t review it in time
is not only about being engineer or student
i finally passed the exam
in the tower of york activity was interesting to view the importance of the coordination and the group roles and even though we didnt win i am very happy with the resulting tower
due to spend more time than expected in this area leads that i do not have enough time to calm down to learn and research
i would say the biggest difference between my undergraduate course and this msc is the fact that there are no exams for this and having summative assessments throughout this year is something that is really different my bsc involved just 2 weeks worth of exams at the end of the entire year
i think there are many obstacles in my academicsuccess such as laziness lack of planning failure to complete tasks accordingto plan and poor consciousness of time management
they are creative but they are poor of time management
that inspired me a lot i think this will be a valuable experience for him in any way
the speech must have a fixed logical concept just like being unable to leave the title and exploring the whole topic
every time i would make sure that all the notes i have taken must be understood by myself so next time i review my notes i could understand them clearly
it is reasonable for example if i am not good at report writing i can make up my final mark by improving other parts mark
why not just look at board and take note
but i think the content is a bit more because we may not be able to accept so much information in one lesson
a lot of homework is via internet in uk and in china we just do the homework offline
a lot of keywords was shown on the slide
our teacher always give us a lecture which with logical content moderate speaking speed and clear voice
i think group members need more communication
encounter difficulties can be data problems or can not solve the problems
the teacher and classmates gave me a lot of encouragement and let me know my own problemsthis was a very failed experience which i could not forget
the programme is a combination of both electronics and management which is why i chose university of york
the current state of development of the industry
definitely i aspire to be a distinction grade student not only for application of phd but also for my own principle to be a good one in every group
in that case to make my notes on laptop clearly i will use different size title to mark some key point and make easy arrangement to make the layout looked logistic and reasonable
evidence the researches by experts published books journals news social accepted theories
its exactly what i expected because it can make the classroom atmosphere more active and help the students concentrate on the lecture
i think i can share information and materials with others because resource sharing can improve our efficiency and expand our thinking
the most important tings is thatwe should tolerate and understand each other
in the matter of fact it is not an easy thing to complete
firstly as a student we should be work hard in class and try to obtain as much knowledge as you can
in life maybe i am a little quiet person so there are not many problems are trying to do their own things
we do not need to understand the meaning of every word
when there is a problem please ask the teacher the teacher will be very patient to help you answer the question first confirm your problem and then help you answer the question through the content case explained in the class
5
after participating in works we have had many conferences and meetings in kinds of ways so it is especially important to take notes or meeting summaries
at the same time teamwork has taken a positive part in my currentcurriculum and it has contributed a lot to my lifefirstly collaborative learning is apositive way to urge effective inspections of different team members
apart from that i think that using examples reasonably to explain what i am going to talk about is another thing i will take from the lecturers and use it myself when i give a talk
then the teachers teachingprocess is basically based on courseware with some interesting practicalexamples
the teaching style is satisfactory
i do learn and feel the multiactive linearactive and reactive model through the cultural differences
for myself i think i am confident and skillfulbut of course i am not a perfect person
after the first week i have a new understanding of these contents
when i was an undergraduate i was mainly taught by professors
yes in some cases
so my notes wont be much
but this situation is really common in our society maybe in the future i will meet the problem which need my carefully consideration
but in york i always use buses and walking
each of us gavean opinion about the issue
and we also had the chance to work with each other
the powerpoint in the lecture are clear its easy to follow
if the situation worsens it may lead to teamdissolutionfourth all the group members are not goodat learning
the teachers were able to teach the students very well during class because they were familiar with what they were talking about and they had a very clear framework in their minds
whats more communication skills in group work we need to haveregular meetings and it is important to express ourselves well and make fulluse of negotiate skills
although i do not have the same profound teaching experience as the teacher but as long as careful preparation will not play well
so i really like his class
when i work with my group members i found that they have lots of academic experience or work experience before which allows them to have more experience in the presentation or academic papers and also leads better results
i always take notes and i usea series of tools to help myself stay on top of deadlines but sometimes it could be really mess
i hope that this longterm communication can promote the tacit understanding and relationship between the team members and the supervisor
in the class i found that not only chinese people are friendly but also the foreigner people are friendly
about a half of the first term has been past i should stay focus on how to be a distinction grade student
what they say is important to the course
it is not reasonable but every chinese student can accept the rule
in the beginning stage of my study in the university of york i always tried to write down the whole sentences
in the 27 september there was a interesting team workused paper to build a high and stable tower which made me surprised
it is also very important to cultivate the rapport and feelings between the members and a good smart leader
environmental design hasfewer work options but em has a wide range of career choice
using bodylanguage to make people understand you easily3
goodslides using some basic slides is very useful
however it is different in york
i think in the future modules i will rely heavily on teamwork
the content of the slides is very clear and the focus is obvious
although i had a ppt it was just an outline
i think everyone is very good usually i did a good listener
the result of the test showed that i was good at test results in a team and i was not good at encourage my teammates
but fortunately every class has ppt which can help me understand the teachers content very well and i can quickly add content to it
i dont have the habit of recording and scheduling time
from the next term we will try and be more decisive about our decision making as this would not waste much time
yes i think the teamwork were quite interesting and it can practice our cooperative ability
i am enjoying it so far and i feel like thats going to continue
this situation reminds me of the first period that i came to uk to study in high school course
i really like the teaching style here
when it comes to the behaviours which can foster success i think it might be several factors
the lecturer will divide some content he wants to talk into several aspects and then put them on the ppt in order
but in the induction week i join one group activity with my classmates
frankly i can not say his mathematical lectures were always very fun especially fourier transform slides but he always adds some humour which makes me to focus on them
i cant notice any major differences at the moment from the bsc course
so i think we should write down as many ideas as wu can and then we select a best one to put on
i had a group with lowcommitment with the assessments
so we have to spend much time on explain our ideas and try to understand what is others thinking
the language due to the low uncertainty avoidance chinese have a unique language art the best example to explain that is taichi
only in this way can we complete the homework more perfectlysecondly i found that each of our team members has their own strengths
though i had stayed away from my university life for a long time now “ deadline ” is the one thing that has kept me running through my work life
whats more i understand what should i notice in the next year like time management team work
i learn that we should noy only learn book knowledge but also learn to use it
as a result i can remember most of his word
i think i have the confidence to complete my postgraduate study
john issitt firstlyi would like to talk about international business lectureri would say he is really good in delivering knowledge about international businessfrom first lectures how he taught us about culture then giving us examples of hofstedes cultural dimensions theory which is a framework for crosscultural communication then he told us about lewis model for cross culture and dimensions by i learnt about how we can deal with different people behaviors during in business dealing and during communicationthe best thing we did is playing role as a group and learn about different cultures of different countriesjohn gives us one country and give us situation so we have to deal that situation by acting like that countries people so it was a great way of learning for mejohn is very comprehensive in his lectures in a very entertaining way so really enjoyed his lectures with getting useful and effective knowledgebidyaut baruah i would say he is incredible and more comprehensive in his way of teaching with the help of different videos and case studies which really helped out in understanding of marketing strategies of different companiesduring fall how companies make strategies to come up with more potential how they make their failures to successanother aspect of his teaching is more friendly and open his way of delivering lecture is so attractive and striking in our minds quicklyfurthermorein making our enterprise business idea more wide and clearhe introduces us with swot strategy and analyse your business strengthsome of the attributes of his lectures are he is pace the lecture appropriatelygenerate curiosity about the lecture material early in the classroomvery concisenoel jackson he is teaching us management of technology and the way of his teaching is really impressive with providing real practical examples of energy resources and he tries to illustrate practical applications of the theory presentedhe presented the material in a more clear and logical sequencenoel make the material accessible intelligible and meaningfulanother important prospect generation of enterprise business ideas he gives us valuable suggestions upon our ideas so we were clear by which idea we can move forward and create full business planoverallhis way of teaching is demonstrative and also facilitates students to ask questions if they have any type of confusiontony wardwelltony gives us two lecture about law of engineering management with effective knowledge of uk law including criminal and civil laws then we have make different comparisons with other countries law also our assignment is also related to this so it really helped me to clear things about my assignmentfurthermoretony knew what he is talking aboutwe asked different questions and he replied us in a very effective wayjoanna north one of the best teacher her lecture is always full of energy and motivation with prior knowledge with some real case studies and real examples of business strategies of different businesses
establish group norms avoiding group member to absent from a meeting3
what is currentlypreventing me from being a distinction student is time management
the current professional is relatively easy so there is not much repetitive work and compared with the internship i have done before the overall will be relatively simple4 the environment for learning is different
i checked my usual behavior thought reading the statement of ethical principles for engineers and i did not act in violation of the ethical principles of engineers
in fact i find that when the group assign the task each group member carefully think about and complete the task in time they will get succeed and get a good ranking
had questions in the course and discussed it with the professor
they have good language skills to make student follow them
4
at least 80 of my classmates in york are come from china
9pay more attention to the cultivation of students interest
all the lecture present the material in a clear and logical sequence and cover the subject matter adequatelyall the lecturers demonstrate an expert knowledge in their subjectyesi can clearly hear the lecturer voice and slides are also very clear about what they are demonstratingyes their contact with us obvious and clear with some good engaging activities specially john and joanna has good engaging skills with studentsi didnt see any notes because their slides are very clear and effective so we can easily understand what they want to say and what they want to deliver
this is most prominent in international business with the many activities that are set for groups to do though i dont find this method of lecturing to help teach the subject to me personally it helps the other students from what ive observed
the more significant a concept is the greater the amount of content associated with it in the notes is thus showing its level of importance
i like using the 4 pictures to create a new thing because i understand my teammates ability
yes of coursei think i can become an engineering managerfirstlyi should avoid deceptionbecasue this is a very serious problem in chinamaybe i should take strict management measuressecondlyi should accept others ideas because sometimes i just trust myself
i am satisfied with the interactionand the lecturers are very humorous as well as patient
i am able to understand my notes when i review them
the second thingis making a schedule which can ensure they can have a productive day and donot waste time
i think many factors are essential for successful collaborative learning but task assignment is especially important because in a group different people are responsible for different task and then these tasks need to be connected
every sentence is wellfounded
only inthis way can we achieve success and get a distinctionhowever i can not do well in the twopoints
the lecturers will mobilize the enthusiasm of the students through some small games or interactive sessions
i did not have any questions but they were answered well for people that asked
this was what i was expecting
i know it would not be easy to get this achievement but i am sure i will try my best to get the success
re some challenges for my group
i think i didnt take actions that against the rae ethical principle
after studying combine with the theory and case is also important for the future
what we have to do is how to use these times efficiently
they have the most important information they are very clear and understandable
i remember seeing a student in the class
it always be a group work
noel and bidyut can be judged as humourous to some degreestrategy management north give us the table of content of the whole course so we can have general idea of this course
i think it will be hard work but i am confident that i have the academic support to see it through
one important thing is that we should be confident
i think dr baruahs powerpoint is the most clear one
really looking forward to it
in my last degree most courses were delivered by chinese but here all are given by english which is really a big challenge to understand the lecturers at the beginning2
physical and mental health course really impress me a lot health is fundamental in our study life i like that kind course for new at the university of york
she sometimes uses the humor in order tomotivate us
so maybe during the lectures everything is fine and i understand all but later when i want to review again the topics i realize that i dont remember the little gears that make all have sense for me
different research directions
environmental design is sensible em isrational it requires strong scientific research ability and interpersonalskills
the level of interaction is as expected
to compare them all chinese teaching style is more serious and passive to me because most of the chinese education is examoriented education finnish teaching style is more or less than the style in uk which is relaxed and interactive
so when i finish every class i will organize notes and review the lecture in order to make it clearly
first the teachers give references on their slides about the data and pictures
after answering they will ask the questioner and other students if the answer is satisfactorywhen i ask them questions in private when i ask them a question they will make it more specific and then answer me in detail and concretely at the same time they will remind me of the relevant knowledge points
but coming to europe is very expensive to me
thus sometimes it is difficult for me to fall asleep in the past
when we communicate with each other to be honest it is a difficult process
i think i have to make some change which means i should reject some invitations so as to work and study more efficiently and timely3
two daysbefore the end of the holiday i realized that the winter vacation was nearlyover but my homework was not written yet
group cooperation needs to emphasise planning and efficiency
i think we should learn from each other and help each other in our study and life
after a month of classes i found myself improving and changing in some aspects but there are still many problems that will become obstacles to future learning
i think to catch the opportunity is important
pursue a better working attitude
besides the experience shared by the previous students can help us in better learning of the course
if the leader doesnt know the task clearly the teamwork can be unsuccessfulall in all many factors can lead to the unsuccessful teamwork we should try to avoid them
i think it is a good way to teach usand all of my teachers will give us a clear logic and structure for us to master this kind of knowledge
some group meeting pay more attention on their facebook or instagram account they chat with other people duiring a collaborative learning
however some of them dont know how to cooperate with their group members and are not tolerant of group members
it was a painful time
first i am lazy i always think about moving things to tomorrow and then there will be countless tomorrows and i can not be able to finish my homework at the end
i think i will take these from them and use myself when i give a talk
someof them were related with all this new environment the culture the weatherthe food in summary a complete change in my usual lifestyle
there are also differences in the way students are assessed
confidencebuilding is essential
i think its very useful both in life and workchallenge statements orpolicies that cause them professional concern
i need to work hard in the future to dedicate more to the group
there are a lot of assignments
because of political problems and sovereignty issues between taiwan and china sometimes it is avoided or skipped when chatting with my classmates
however other culture like england is alsodifferent the ways they are work in collaborative learning
yes after the first week of induction i am looking forward to learning em in the next year
from the beginning i was nervous and orderly
whether our group will do the project by us 3 while the other groups all have 6 people
for example if my friend want to go shopping after school without saying i would like to go home directly to study i will go to the shop with her i always afraid that if i do not accompany with her she may feel lonely
humor is a good way for me to learn from one part to the other part
recently i learn that another approach called reverse brainstorming
students usually have few problems
finally i can learn some gestures from them to make my presentations more vivid
i think it is a kind of behavior of culture difference between western and orient
thisexperience told me that i should reasonably arrange my time and manage what ihave to do instead of putting everything around the deadline
because in china many teachers are tend to teach the knowledge which we will test in the exam and students easily lose interests in other knowledge outside the exams
i know i made a mistake will also cause procrastinationso i want to change this kind of bad habit
i hope that we can join more activities which can help us know about our course more clearly
however some of my classmates tried to raise their hands and express their opinion i think this is a good newsif more students want to express their opinion the courses could be more interesting
i also feel that for some students myself included taking extensive notes can distract from completely listening to the material that is being delivered
the scope and specification of the lecture is well
you might like to discuss your comments with your academic supervisor
i think this will save time and make it easier for us to finish our homeworkmeanwhile if i meet some problems in study i would be more than happy to ask help from others and have a discussion to get the correct answer
it must have a scientific division of labor which can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of collaboration
in a word i am getting well with the academic work than the majority of others
sometimes i was not brave to raise my hand to ask or answer questions
the lecture was packaged and delivered effectively and we can comprehend main ideas and access to some details on timethe slides are also very clear with appropriate size and front of words as well as colorsthe lecturer contacted with our eyes sometimes and can focus more on his presentation
secondly i think every groupmates should do some adapt for group according to the reality situation in our group
i think we are lack of not only knowledges but also experiences
actually，i am not very good at planning for the longterm plan but i have a very clear goal for everything in the short term for example before i have come to the uk
in fact we have a lot of study time we can have enough time to read a lot of books to help learn
in the uk presentation is also part of the usual investigation6 the campusbritish universities are all beautiful especially in the city of york the university is integrated with the surrounding urban areas
actually i think i am not a good notetaker i need to improve it by learning some efficient methods of note taking
i have always had the habit of taking proper notes during the lectures since my undergraduate program
1good ability of communication2a suitable place for collaborative learning3punctuality and responsibility
the differences between current em at york and my last formal education are1 my last degree is civil engineering it has many calculations but now there are no calculations2
in the lecture sometimes i felt that i paid too much attention in the some specific points in the meanwhile i lost some other important contents
teachers tend to follow textbooks to design course and test
then l can review them according to the order l list
then we should also be aware of what is the disadvantage of ourselves then we could be able to trying to fix these drawbacks in ourselves
： when professor provided some picture or opinion every time there always have sources or reference in the slides
meanwhile lecturers make eye contact with the audience all the time to ensure the feeling of each audience
i cant write down the original words of the teacher
the second is the issue of cultural differences
the interesting activity and lovely teacher are my expected
through these two months study i get a lot of knowledges about business law marketing and strategy
i only know that i can solve problems with the experience of my predecessors
now i have been allocated to a new team we have 7 people now
now i am a good collaborator and i would like to try to become a group leader
i was surprised that many postgraduate students still do activities and that encouraged me to join student societies in uni
next thing i learnt in youtube is make a todolist i bring my to do list everything
proper body language and great eye contact withall people in the room will make you looks more confident and elegant
as time went on more and more words were memorized in my notebook but my vocabulary did not grow in sync
the slides of the lectures are very clear and vivid the content is very smooth and the pictures and texts are combined very reasonably
different teaching methods
noels class always tell us about new energy and new technology using these example to be evidence
the teaching so far has been through lectures which is what i expected and what i am used to at university
previewing the course will help you learn better
the teachers here are more interesting and humorous than the ones in china
add some stop between different partsof presentation
although i wasliving with my classroom when i was in my former university i usually worked alonerather than the way i am now —— often work with my groupmates it really improves my learning efficiency and teamwork abilities
i attend each lecture in time and also do some project talk with my team member after class about the enterprise lecture frequently
i will take notes every advises from my lecturers and group matesthink about myself about my drawbacks and promote myself
i need good time management to help me plan and learn
in order to our project are more innovation and efficient i should listen and think carefully about other peoples opinions
i think that for now the content of all the lectures is well defined in advance and also in most of the cases the slides are online a few days before the lesson
dont trust your group members3
i chose to use simple letters or symbols instead of complete sentences
i think it is quite good for me to learn the engineering management
as a matter of fact every course shows case study through vle
only with confidence the speaker can be not nervous so that i can play wellgood body language is also important
in addition in the course of the class due to the influence of language barriers including the preparation of the relevant courses the content of the class is not deeply understood not thorough and the understanding of the new theoretical system academic environment and thinking mode is not enough
his lecture starts with some question forinstance “ who creates laws ”
but also the very first lesson we had i think it was interesting to overview the course and the aim of it
i like those activities very much but i think maybe we can add some activities about personal introduction in it
they will clearly express what they want to express through brief words or pictures
supervision will meet and communicatewith us regularly which is not an aspect in my previous study4
i can understand the contents of the course
sometimes he held little group activitiesto give us a better understanding of this subject and indeed they are quite unforgettable
whowouldn  t want to be outstanding in academic field
with the development of social economy the competition is increasingly intense and the increasingly diverse needs of the employee force our students facing the complex environment
the contents of the lecturer are logical which makes it convenient for us to learn step by step with the contents of the lecturersthe content is so fluid that it doesnt feel like a strange thing suddenly appearsmost of lecturers are humorous
accurately express your ideas to share their knowledge to others and people easily to understandthose are essential for successful collaborative learning
for me now i can accept and respect others culture and thinkings
it is hard for the group to finish the task if their leader didnt know the task clearlyin summary successful collaborative learning need a variety of skills and the factors which influence the collaborative learning should be identified before group working to cooperate well with each other
i think it is helpful for us to know each other and improve our teamwork ability
my name is yimingliu i come from china and i graduated from tianjin university of financeeconomics
in the uk most courses are structured around discussion and case studies
there is no doubt i should have a habits that i should look through the ppt i will learn and familiar with the professional vocabularies and contents before the beginning of corresponding courses
as a result when reviewing my my notes i most of the times know what is going on and its easy to pick it up
after class the answer to the question is very detailed
after the groupmeeting i realized that my inactivity caused me to fall behind others
you can also use teamwork in your homework which will give you a higher idea and everyone will get more ideas
which could also make unsuccessful for a collaborative learning
it seems that they are happy to help us solve problemsthey normally confirmed over and over again whether i understood
in a farreaching vision collaborating with others is inevitable in the future
and there are some students absent
the teacher does not teach all the knowledge to you in detail
not much exam2
i learn to how to use indirect referenceand some detailed requirements
at the same time i am also a person who likes to be lively
i think every lecturer provided us a clear and organized sessions from week to week so we could have a plan at the beginning of semester which is really different from chinese teachers who are used to give tasks separatelyin strategy lecture the lecturer gives me a deep impression because she is good at directing student by asking questions interacting with us and giving some relevant assignments
the lecture is very good and each lecture will cover all the information on the slides
the notes are divided into three parts
to be honest my english listening is very bad
i think the group game is useful
for example the majority of us have no idea about the 4th industry revolution she told from the 1st industry revolution to 3rd industry revolution and she leaded us to think the 4th industry revolution
the scope of the lectures should be presented in a simpler and more general way
that led to the audience confused about content and then give up to listen
otherwise if it is fired it will break the law
the lectures have a good clarity and detailed explanations by the lecturers make it more understandablethe technical concepts are being taught with some good case studies so we could relate it much with the realtime examplesalso the lecturer has a very good experience on the subject so he possesses a firm grip on to the contents of the lecture while delivering it to us making it more interactive and interesting to learnthe group activities conducted between the lectures makes us more engaged during the lecture hours
although sometimes we argued and had different views and ideas we helped and tolerated each other to finish our work successfully
so i often read some positive books or watch some inspirational videos and i can keep hardworking for a period of time then i may abandon some plans
the second thing is that i would be influenced easily by otherswhen i paid attention on studying if someone interrupt me i would stopstudying to talk with him
they clarified very well my questions with examples and real cases
and i think i need to improve my ability of taking notes
they dont use notes most of them just use the slides via powerpointpersonal effectiveness and masterclasses the lecture is quite interesting and useful and it will deliver basic function of tools and some basic skills such as presentation and reference skills efficiently
generally i will only go through the past course materials before the exam and then list some of the essential test points that the lecturer has raised by memory
in china we learnt different courses separately
they did the preparation of class
and every email could answer my question efficiently
most students donot like answering questions
when looking back into my third year i feel like there is a massive step up
from the initial market positioning to the final self positioningcombined with the content of the career course the whole course organization seems to be more plentiful
although you have some questions on the class you can just raise your hand most of teachers prefer to finish their class and you can ask them questions after class or during the break
i often encountered things i didn  t understand
the biggest thing surprises me is that in my class there are many students they have severalyear working experience
engineers needs discussion to inspire ideas
and the most important is that sometimes i can not determine the importance of every material and classes so the notes also dont have the importance
in my first degree teacher usually teach student by writing in the blackboard it is easier to understand than the current teach method as a result i should pay more attention to understand what teacher say2secondly team work become more important than before there would be some team work assignments in my study but first degree no
obey the arrangement obey the discipline do not leave your seat casually do not say anything unrelated to learning when discussing in groups make a speech in order with a light voice without affecting other groupslearning when submitting to the opinions of the majority of the group personal opinions can be reservedhelp
we can see many of us working in the library after the course which contributes to a wonderful atmosphere of studying
i shared a dormitory with 5of my classmates in my former university now i live alone
i dont write every slides from powerpoint like certain other classmates
the induction program let me know about the program of courses and how to find help from teachers but i think only when attending the course i can evaluate the course
ill try my best to obey every principles
but i is hard to say that i can 100 percent get rid of them
in contrast the behaviours such as procrastinating，being negative，being lazy would hinder successa behaves positively in our class and he is willing to have interaction with tutors
actuallyi am certainly surprised the teaching style during the program because i learnt more new methods about thinking and practicing
one of the evidence of research or background knowledge of the subject is accounting because we will learn knowledge about finance next week in the lecture enterprise
i think that whether it is learning or going to work work efficiency is the most important because only 24 hours a day everyone can control the same time
community activities the activities of the clubs here are more abundant and there are many opportunities for people to know and communicate
our teachers do thy their job well
with everyone in the group possessing some of the qualities required to be a engineering manager in the future we still need to work on a lot of things and aspects that are required
i think i have many things need to learn in this field sometimes i find the methods in youtube
i thought my uni had very informal and easygoing atmosphere in classes but it would take some time like one semester to get closer and being informal each other but our course had more friendly air
now my style need to changei must use the model learned in order to solve the problems
isometimes affect the efficiency of class because of poor sleep quality atnight and lose my attention because of sleepiness
welli have learnt a lot of things specially in last week lecture from master class of personal effectiveness we have been discussed about presentation skills and i implement those skills in international business three minutes presentation and it was really good according to john issitt from joanna i learnt a lot of things how she is working a business consultant what things are really important in communication with clients and with case studies you can help in accessing other business situationmost important thing is speaking skills i am trying to adopt some good speaking skills by teachers how they fluently speaking in front of a lot students so these are the important things on which i am working and things are improving and i am happy with all this
to my surprise i have an active team and aresponsible mentor
to be honest i really admire him because i think sometimes i actually have ideas about problems
in my opinion i think that taking right position in a group and working hard are very important factors
i like do that and i like exploring something new
we need to go deeper into the assignments in order to discover if there is a notorious difference
the slides come in different forms but basically they clearly contain what they want to tell
english is not my native language or nonsecond language
apart from this aspect i found that many of my classmates are used to reviewing before classes
at the first time i can not understand the tutors meaning totally but after a period of time i get improved in this section
i think ive violated ethical principles
teaching content i need to learn more by my self finding information to finish assignment now2
now the week 6 is nearly over but our progress is slow which worry me a lot
i can quickly understand the members  ideas and put them into actioni think listening embracing and respecting other peoples ideas every idea has to be supported by sufficient evidence
and every teacher is humorous
i think getting an overview of how the departments work and getting to know some of the members of stuff was very useful
i can never use violence to solve problems or money although i dont have much money ha ha ha
for professional courses i may need some time to understand chinese
all the activities are useful actually
this is a performance of eating and drinking
as a result i could not study at all
we all have different ideas some enhance our own abilities some bring innovation and enhance communication and collaboration between people
so i need some time to overcome these difficulties but the oneyearmaster study is so short that im not sure i have enough time to cover it
usually as a new thinking pioneer of a group i will bring a lot of new ideas to the group and then actively participate in the discussion and lead other team membersi remember once there was a situation where i was in a very passive and frustrating environment because my thoughts were not adopted but they used an idea that i didnt understand or even hate
most lectures i have been through here leaves mehuge impact not only for the accuracy they have been delivered but also the humorin it
there will have a lot of academic problems thatwe have not solved in our academic work
i can not fully understand what the teacherteaches so i can only learn by ppt and reading books recommended by theteachertherefore what the teacher tells in class may be useless to mesometimes i even can not understand the jokes told by the teacher and becauseof my weak oral expression ability i am not willing to communicate directlywith the teacher or classmates in englishanother question reflected in groupdiscussion as compared with the positive expression of personal opinion iprefer to listen to the opinions of others and then think about other peoplesopinions finally it is concluded that for me i think the right answer socompare group discussion when i was in silence always speak out their views inthe other group members after sum up a word or two as my point of view andother team members will think im not active and not into the team workfinally may cause our relationship brokenfinally i spent too much time ontravel due to my curiosity about british cities and culture which affected mystudy time and led to the decline of learning quality
that makes lectures not very fluent
generally i use different color pens to mark different points and draw some structure diagrams to help take notes
so i am curious about my course now
i didnt use to apply this technique before that often but now i am doing this more often and it is really helping me think more which is needed for a management student
in the first two years if we dont have classes in the evening we are required to go to the evening selfstudy classthe earliest time for class is eight o clock11accommodation
to be honest i feel a little bit nervous
actually i didn  t have many assignments which required us to finish with my classmates in china8
if lecturers do not make some interaction which like it is just an action for hisher own and audience can not get some attentionsfinally practice is really important and everyone do not want to hear a lecture with long stop or repetitive words
they will take the initiative to ask questions and have goodcommunication with teachers
definitely i think they were explaining very well in the lecture
ive studied some of the materials but it would take some time to bring my memories back
if the teacher teaches in english i need more time to master what the teacher is saying2 during my undergraduate studies i only need to listen to the teacher to give lectures
in addition group members should learn to help each other understand solve problems together do not shirk responsibility to become a loving group
but looking at the phone so did not pay attention to listen to that part of the class will take time to supplement gain more than the loss
maybe i think we should have a international thinking first the trend of development is globalization
secondly i learn how to get along with others and learn to understand and tolerate the ideas of different people
maybe someone likes work alone someone dont like communicate with others
secondly i think every student wants to a distinction grade students so i am not exception
so in the future i hope i could overcome this challenge and work better with the team
and in a team we also have lots of interactions
one group of classmates study very hard
in britain each tutor with a limited number of students will help solve psychological and emotional problems and communicate with others
as a returning university of york student the style of teaching is what i expected
i like it very much
but sometimes some students are too shy to engage in the class
my way of learning is not very strict
with all these qualities in the group i am sure we can be a ideal supervision group
everyone have their own abilitieswe can use our own abilities in the teamwork and it can help us to resolve the problem faster than beforeas we have some similaritiesit is easy for us to communicate with each other and our thoughts or ideas might become more similar which may let us work together more smoothlythe differences make us have different perspective in the same thingwhich really help us to resolve the problem and overcome the difficultywhen we work as a groupwe can have more different solutions to make our products or project become better
multimedia teaching is now used in the classroom and the teacher will streamline the content of the class to the document which will make it easier for students to understand the central content of the teacherthe teachers focus is on improving students professional skills and professional knowledge
well i am not sure about that give me some time to experience that
why not respect the choice and do that best
we also need the background of management because we have group work assignment and some of our courses are about innovation
i would like that she is going to teach us ideation course
inother words small steps lead to big steps
last but not least i feel that we need to learn empathize，which need us to understand the others feelings and problems
some important academic skills were also taught in these session which is also helpful
i think it told me how to arrange my time about study
even if the lesson is not 100 of our interest
it is a dream that i can be a member of the department of electronic engineering as a postgraduate
in the future ihope to join their group to help me improve my knowledge coverage
fortunately i have had a lot of progress in reading english sources
taking note more important than before
from this experience i learned that i need to open my mind when i face a difficulty that i can not work out it
individual  s ideas are always not comprehensive
due to the large differences in the personalities habits and ways of working between individuals sometimes its hard for a group to set up a common goal and work for it together
once again happy with everything except from the double lecture on audio signals and psychoacoustics which can get very tiring due to being very long
before applying to the course i was careful to at the content of all of the modules and ensured that each of them either fulfils a personal interest or a personal goal
it has became really important to me since i learned how to reference
this teaching style is more open and freedom which give us students more space to think independently
secondly through different lectures i believe that confidence and smile are the most important in the speech which should give the audience a pleasant and relaxed atmosphere
maybe because of the number of students the interaction is not as much as i expected
xin liu is a person who talk very little but do a lot
and ask questions after the lecturemy last course was studied in china
they can help me broaden my vision and think better
because in china normally tutor will directly tell us what do we need to focus and do about our class without interaction
having spoken with the other students on the course i am aware that some have a stronger background in maths and hope that this is also area that we can share knowledge
i think the coffee break is very cool
teaching in york is to give you an idea or model and you must think about it in your free time
on one hand i can see that a little more than half of the class including me are attending to all the lessons trying to arrive at the starting hour and also trying to take advantage of each lesson
in this way it can leaves a depressive impression for us and raise our interests to the mind of other countries
in addition i find there are many differences with the previous learning experience for my first degree in china
this has led to a much more intimate seminarlike atmosphere in lectures as the lecturers and students are a great deal more closely acquainted with one anotherfurthermore the number of students at this university is much smaller than that of my previous one and being in the smaller postgraduate community as opposed to the considerably larger undergraduate one has emphasised this
second they will know what is useful for us and what is acceptable for us and teach these to us
i think successful man should be always full of energy and willing to participate in the meaningful activities around them enthusiastically
in addition we have some team works these tasks cultivated my interpersonal skills cooperation skills communication skills
foster success—1most of my supervisor group team members are willing to share their idea withus
sometimes the teacher willask us to read some materials before the class
it was hard to me at the beginning
inviting people from relevant company to speak making a presentation10
the content is different
i will regularly use collaborative learningin the future
the uneven distribution of tasks among team members and the lack of assignment of tasks following each persons strengths or expertise have led to learning to be blind inefficient and meaningless
there are some good points on mei have the ability to stay focused in stressful situations
hard to describe particular behaviours
as i said above the way to reference was an important discovery for me
and i think the challenges are the balance between economic benefit and social responsibility respect for life law the environment and public good
an example would be that if they were to runlead a project and somebody in their group wasnt pulling their own weight then the leader would get rid of the person from said project with little to no remorse
i hope that i can find the skills for looking up the related material and write an organized article through one years practicesecondly in group activities my personality is a little strong and anxious so sometimes i hope the group activities can be carried out more efficiently
if the team follows this step i think they will surely succeed as a team
i think the msc is different from ipc courses
i think if there is no challenge in the work of the group the whole team will stagnate
so for me i can learn from their experience in developing a learning plan to better carry out my own learningi can help them to communicate with foreign friends to learn the expression of english because language is the basis of all learning so without good english expression will be very inconvenienti think there are four factors that improve collaborative learning
1 the learning environment is different2 teaching methods are different and the university of york has more communication3 homework is differentem has more practice4 the lecture will give more examples during the class5 the teacher  s lectures are very humorous and easy to accept6 em has more interaction between the students7 i have more time to think independently about what the teacher is saying8 the teacher will give you more advice to help you learn9 after class there will be more detailed information to help me review10 em has more presentations to show myself
however team work can always help us to identify new methods which we can not come up by ourselves that is the most important feature
thereis three part that i think i may need to improve
trying to overcome these bad habits is another story
students can answer the questions well even the questions is not cover in the lecture they can answer like professional
the second is the supplement of personal professional knowledge and diligent study to avoid falling behind the speed of technological development which i think is very important for me personally
i am now learning to work hard to do this
i thought that i spent some time painting on my hobby
this is good because some lecture theaters are too large and it can be difficult to hear the lecturer from a distancemost of the lectures are well presented with powerpoint presentations with smooth transitions to the next slide and the slides are immediately available on the vle
they all try to answer my questions perfectly and they always asking us do we have any questions do we understand what they said i think they all try to help us to do better in our study
we are looking for a better solution
i will give full play to my strengths in the team and try my best to cooperate with each member
another thing i want to taking notes are some question i did not figure out immediately in class
as we engaged in these dramas we can flexibly practice what we have learned in the lecture so it will be no problems when the lecturers going to move to the next point
this is quite interesting and fun although it may not be 100 true
besides some of the students seldom listen to the course carefully and always focus on their mobile phone
thispositive thing i am going to practice every day in order to have goodpresentation
it is bad behaviour which will make tutors and other students disappointed and create an unfriendly atmosphere in the class
7elearningelearning is completely new for me and by which i am learning a lot of new things developing english writing skills thinking on past things critically and learn new techniques how to go with future deadlines and how to collaborate with your team members in a group8
and by cooperation reciprocating knowledge or help is key
i am most in need of improvement in recording class content and taking notes
lecturers are looking forward to haveing interactions with us
until now it is a piece of cake for me to make diagrams and maps when l want to take notes
my perception of the course doesnt changed as well as my ways of learning
more interaction in class
i think this is something that should be done because it will affect your concentration of study and work
the thinking and teaching style really surprised meim very happy with the induction programme
as i am still studying engineering management and have not participated in any work or internship so there is no violation of engineering ethics
they are very patient to answer the question of the classmate
i cant always find keywords with slide because always finding keywords with slide help will make me miss something
although i am not sure about my future i am lucky to havesuch a partner and supervisorthe expectation for the course may dependon the above description but it is more about my own efforts
with the help of them i feel happy to be in the environment of msc in em
if we can take advantage of our differences we will be perfect partners whereas we may face a lot of arguments
in order to deepen our understanding of the knowledge our lecturers often show many cases to us which is more easier to digest the knowledge
for example i act as a leader in our group i should know clearly about the task
the way we learn here is really good and overall its a new learning experience
the effective communication and time management can be my challenge in future group work
yes my major is civil engineering before and i have never had the course about management
buses are often late
for example most of our majors are carried out in the form of a group practice or group discussion and analysis
and even i dont know what is the balance should i assign the work
this also makes me not have a deep understanding and understanding of my professional knowledge
these behaviours do harm to the msc learning in the long run
usually i will complete my academic work carefully and try my best to do it
because not only do we deepen our understanding of each others team members in this type of activity but also enhance our ability to communicate in teams and may also increase our ability to communicate in english
i had tried my best to answer this question but it is difficult tomeet the requirement
we need to read a lot of literature according to the requirements given by the teacher put forward our own opinions and find strong evidence to support this view
i think it is not a big problem for any experienced teacher
this course aiming to teach us some basic skills in studying and the background knowledge is easy for us to pick upenterprise this course needs us to do a whole business plan about the products and we need to do the marketing part and financial part
i can observed that we have three strengths which are imagination creativity and organization
i hope that teachers and students interact more such as throwing more questions for students to answer so as to give students some space to think
besides thatdifferent leadership styles will improve our teamhinder success1
1teaching style in class in yorkthe teacher always lectures with ppt and makes detailed explanations around the ppt content
in the same way i could see the slides clearly when i sat at the any position in the room
it is really useful for students
after eating breakfast and coming to the library the first thing is to take out the mobile phone open wechat and browse some information
as i have mentioned before i think the ethic is really important for everyone of us and every job
i should keep in modest all the time no matter in success of failure
working actively with your group will make your work more efficient
their attitudes of study encourage me
i have found my own problems and i will solve them through my own efforts
after the induction part i have a deep understanding of the university of york and during the process of the induction programme i konw more my classmates and my study
although these courses are not many they allow us to become familiar with a new profession within a year so i am very much looking forward to the schools plan
if i want to achieve distinction i should spend my time on study for entertainment
but i do think its important to have different personalities in the group as this will keep the group in harmony
no lecturer dismiss the class not on time
indeed when i check my class notes after a long time i have to combine slides and notes together in order to understand it
finally the combination of different personal factorscan be a hindrance to teamworkfor theside of team
this can help me have different ways of thinking
during our induction programme we need to do the mission as a group which was a rare way in my previous learning experiences
however teammates just offer a position if it should be applied to a homework we have to do research and provide evidence to support itwhen other group members speak its also a time to broaden your own horizons
but i still found someone sleeping in the class which is surprised me
in this process students got promotion in the understanding of the issue and it means they did listen to and taking part in the course rather than pretending listening
i think i can obey these principles
so i think that a activity which we need to build the tallest tower and keep the oranges from falling is very useful
therefore we hardly have difficult questions
the first point is to promote teamwork and build a teamwork environment
so when we face the task i know that discussion is our first task then we need to communicate give everyones opinion and make a decision
in the process of doing academic work understanding the aim of job is first important thing
the content and the form of the course are the same as i have known before
a good introduction is very important
it isalso a process of mutual love and mutual help to communicate with each otherthis process promotes the improvement of students communicative ability andenables students to not only forget their love and devotion but also regulaterestrain and guide their classroom behaviors
they try to give us more and more so they sometimes speak a little bit quickly
to sum up try everything hard and always prepare something when you have a meeting
half of the first term has passed and during this time although i have encountered some problems that i never met before i have learned a lot of new skills st the same time
however i found that my speed does not allow me to record all the content at all
i believe that everyone would like to get the best degree during university
the most significance one i will use the red cycle and red pen writing to show it
what my expected teaching style
i always study by myself in my undergraduate but now i can adjust to groups study
mutual respect is also critical because everyone have equalchance to express hisher own thoughts when mutual respect exists in the group3
sometimes i can not find some useful information or research data efficiently
i have learned a lot during this periodin this time independent learning has took up a large part and i began toadapt to this new learning mode
i think everyone needs to change this kind of situation
critical thinking8
the first thing is laze
the lectures were really more student focused and involved more of the student participation
actually i know this is not a good habit and it is a waste of time
only then i can really become better and become a good student
i have learned to cooperate with people in the three years of undergraduate study
i think we can do a good job this year
for example tell us more information about our career and what type work that we can do
some of them are humorous and some belong to the academic school who are very seriousfor example the law
the teacher will give some examples before the class or introduce the historical background or social phenomenon related to the topic as well as introduce the phenomenon about this topic in different countries in the course
as time goes by it is easy to be withdrawn incharacter and the isolated self is often one step closer to depression
for example in the last week  s strategic management for em class
in my undergraduate study the library opened 24 hours a day is not as popular as york university
such as ppt and presentationfifth the uk focuses on teamwork and personal work
inthe marketing of technology class dr bidyut baruah told us about the origin of nikes slogan andthe different research methods used in marketing
both books articles video pictures and websites are distributed and consulted according to the knowledge points explained
by contrast to some poor studentsthey are full of curiosity at the beginning of the term and they want to studyhard to achieve their goal
unfortunately i cant say thatcollaborative learning had been a great experience
disagreements will make the discussion stagnant
im not sure what does the words evidence of research mean but i think every lecturer have tried to introduce us the history and the background of those subject just like the international business which began with the ancient trades between different countries so this lecture requires some economic knowledge including communication and cooperation
after each lesson the lecturer asks us if there is something we dont understand a question we dont understand or a question we want to discuss
first of all the two months of subject learning have gained a lot not only the academic gains but also the improvement of personal abilities which is a good exercise for the individual
i think the most important ability in cooperation is execution
i often use my native language to take notes in class notes
another big difference is that we areassigned to study in groups in york
critical thinking patient listening good expression and modesty
all the questions i asked them were answered patiently and properly by them
it makes me more familiar with the course
i learned some skills that how to work with a teamin this amazing afternoon we had our firstgroup activity
every lecturers are happy to answers ours questions we can get what we want after answering the questions
in york sometimes i have seminars
i major in accounting in the university when i was the undergraduate student but i change my major in master i found that many of my classmates in engineering management major in engineering and i afraid of some technical course
now i am using thistechnique because i think that can understand better when i review my notes
i believe that my academic performance is qualified
civil engineering has to do experiment in the lab but now there are not5
the more time management you do the closer you get to successhinder success on the contrary what hinder success is that you can not manage your time and have no selfdiscipline
i dont like to go to the gym
somegestures using some gestures is good for audience to understand yourpresentations such as pointing some key points
firstly every group member has advantages and disadvantages
forexample just writing the key words and after class i can try to remember theimportant information by the key word
yes i need manage my time better
during the lectures in these weeks each teacher will give some questions to the students and have a group discussion which will help students better understand the course content and improve the classroom atmosphere
i think in my group that we need to set up a time for our meeting time or someone will always be busy
usually lecturers explain the main points on the slides very clearly and they often ask the students in the back if they can hear them clearly
although sometimes i think study is boring i will try my best to achieve my target
especially andy ios module is very funny and their classes are quite entertaining
i think all activities are good for us to know about courses
teachers found relevant information from many network platforms such as youtube to make a detailed description and analysis of what we learn
firstly everyone of the group members should donate their strength
on the other hand the projects themselves are so much more interesting
tonyward defines his topic well
finally i strongly believe that equality is required as every person should participate to the extent that they can towards the mutual goal
thus the chinese culture lead we are a restrained society we think that we have the perception that our actions are restrained by social norms and feel that indulging ourselves is wrong
i believe that a key to success is balance
both kinds of presentation are normal and clear
all lectures are ended with the plan for the next one so there is always a time to prepare before the next lecture
once in our group meeting we started blindly because we didn  t know what to do different from the previous group meeting that we all know clearly what tasks to accomplish
because the projects i work for may be related to property health and safty to other people
i hope that i can also integrate into a good learning atmosphere learn more skills and knowledge and constantly improve my learning ability
every time we ask the questions the lecturer would appreciate the question at first i think it is an encouragement for more and more of us to ask and whether the questions are simple or complicated the lecturer would give the patient answer
at all i think they all very kind they treat us like a friend a family it is really helpful to me as a oversea student i really like them all
the second is the domain of the topic
however by considering the large number of students in current major in university of york mostly we learned in big classrooms2
coping with the academic work i think the attitude is the most important factori will keep a good attitude and respect the academic work first and i will trymy best and work hard to facing it
i always previewed the slides before the lectures and i also did independent study after class
however，i found that it would affect me listening the next content
i havent done jung typology test yet but i will do it in the near future and share the results with my team members
before starting a task it is best to set goals and objectives to save time2 maintain a mediumsized group
yesi think it is really useful for msc students to know about some information such as what the conquence will occur if i exceed the deadline and where common study rooms and offices located are
there are not only one student has the talent of leadership
so far my time in york has been good at this point in time work had been conducted on the two assignments that were due in at the end of autumn term strategic management of em and enterprise
thirdly in our group six of us have six different characters which is a doubleedged sword
kind of
ithink teamwork is essential in future learning
because i have preread the reading list in advance at the lecture when john told about these models i could match it to what i have read
yesit must be what i expected
chinese universities usually focus on the teaching of theoretical knowledge which is assisted by the learning of internship
and then the selfmanagement is also necessarythe last but not least we also need to have some knowledge of enterprise
many a little makes a mickle i thinkthis might be one of the small factors that prevented me from succeeding
this allows me to locate the information i want quickly and to elaborate and modify it when im doing a review or group discussion
yesi ami dont worry about the year ahead because i will follow the teachers instructions step by step
the second is the team work paper bridge building our team win the chocolate price in this programme
this programme make me realised that what teamwork important it is
however i realized that during the work i also need some individualism which means that i should complete some assignments independently so that i could play an important role in company
i need to find more books that are related to the lectures
honestly i really enjoy here
every time someone have different opinions i should listening to others reasons firstly rather than eager to deny themthe way of speaking is important need more patient to talk with
i will take my responsibility as a leader firstly and confidently2
lack of emotional management
people from various backgrounds can help and improve each other when they understand their differences
for instance i remembered that during my presessional course study my summative report required us to analyze 2 factors that lead to the samsung note 7 explosion scandal
at the very beginning i take notes in a notebook in each course i need to prepare one and need to take it every day the vocabulary is the most common part in my notebook while it is difficult for me to remember what the lecturer taught in class after several days
normally the lecture has large amount of knowledge for each student to understand especially in some difficult module
different language2
i believe that is the best way to achieve my selfworth
also i would the second one is take in the class i would hear what the doctor saying clearly and write down that i think important and when i finally review my notes i would check the question i  ve written before and ask myself have you known it now
and everyone has his her own thoughts and maybe sometimes weshould take much more time to arrive at agreement
in china every university has a front door marked with the name of the university which looks very imposing and has a sense of age
i didnt dare to ask the lecturer when there was a problem in class and i forgot to ask after class
but you have to admit it ispartially depending on your talent
so i try to encourage them and set goals make proper plans and clarify the responsibility so that other people would not feel too much pressure upon the tasks
so each course i am putting all my energy in order tounderstand well
i try to write down key point so i can recall the contents
to a large extent i think these are mostly positive differences
there are many more accidents like this and it can be very very dangerous to push a task to a deadline in a few hours
in addition i always pay attention to the details in the group discussion which tends to lead to more work and waste time and doing more meaningless work
yes good interaction between teachers and students
the teacher will give a speech to each knowledge point and combine it with some examples to help students understand the course content more quickly and accurately
we need to work together to complete it
but he had alittle weakness that i could observe in the last class
during the period of all the class i tried to take down some important notes on the basis of understanding
although i was an ipc student and have known a lot about school i think the introduction programme still showed me many new things
in my view communication is important in the group because it contributes to the distribution of work and the maintenance of relationships between members
and if i have test questions i will wirte the question in red pens and ask tutors for help or search answers through the internetby doing these i can understand my notes easily when i review them
actually i am also a pessimist because i have failed many times before
in order to achieve this principle i need to do a lot of research with public this is really difficult for me
use colour and shape to make the notes distinctive
i am worried about improving my english and try to get a distinction degree
there are 4 chinese students 1 pakistani and 2 british including me
when i am taking notes lecturer have spoken many word
weve done the assignments for marketing technology and strategy and weve discussed group assignments for other courses but we havent found any specific challenges yet
because my notes are very easy to understand and they are all clear
our group has not shared the jung typology test yet but if we have some questionnaires in team roleplay for my situation i will separate the team project and the work into different members and that we all have the 2nd role in the test we will discuss and balance everyone to do the right things and play the role which each member want to do
for example my analysis ability i often use websites to look forsome information to do research when i have homework or something else
his idea is not only creative but he shares his thoughts with his classmates without reservation
the introduction of the school and various subjects is very detailed
another bad habit is i am more willing to gather everything before the deadline
right the lecturers are very logical noel is very rigorous john is humorous and passionate bidyut is very dynamic jo is good at activating the atmosphere in class and they can help me move from one point to another
i am satisfied with the programmei am looking forward to the year ahead
i have seen some student being late on classesincluding myself
i most admire that each lecturer does not need to use any notes during the lecture
lots of reports and presentationin china，all the final inspection were exams
also digesting the course content and solving the problem timely will foster success
in the powerpoint tutors can always give every key point which related to the main topic
while others only do one thing but perform bad
not at all
however i think the commonn reason is that sometimes members can not listen to others opinion which can lead toquarrels
some tiny things might influence people in a way thatyou can  t even imagine
the induction has not changed my study plan because the oneyear foundation course has given me a certain understanding of this years course
but the chinese accounting system are different from the british accounting systemstrategy management this course mainly taught us about the commercial strategy and i do have some background knowledge about the commercial
i wouldlike to share about two aspects about the style of teaching and how i amapplying myself to learningmost professors use the same style of teaching
people from my course are generally well prepared for masters course
i will try to learn more autonomously in the future modules and at the same time i will get rid of my procrastination problems
when they start a new topic make a note of what they emphasize and then fill in the details when i have time
during this induction programme the most useful thing is group competition
at the same time he told us that he will speak about globalizationspeaking of the power point i prefer the marketing of technology class bidyuts ppt have strong structure and really clear for me i can follow him and i can catch the scope of the lecture
some case studies like volkswagen the childrens party and fake photography we have already read
she always concentrates on the tutor in class and take notes carefully
i have never in such a situation that is contrary to rae
the induction did not especially change my thinking about the programme or my learning
in the enterprise class we have to finish the business plan by a groupdeveloping a business plan will make us more aware of teamwork and we gain a lot of knowledge by checking the informationstrategic management for em tutor recommend us to read a book i can learn more useful information from this book
i think the most helpful lesson is about how to use the libery resources
he is patient and a good listener
everyone have their own special thinking and be willing to spare no effort to support the groupwe lack a leader to unify everyone s opinions to form the final resulteveryone should share their opinion with each other and find a leader to organize the member of the group
there are a few more confident people and some quieter but overall i dont think there are many that are too far over on either end of that scale
there are different kinds of jung typology groupmates in my supervision group
i think the most crucial part of the speech is to convey the intention clearly and vividly to the audience
3i need to improve the ablitily to learn independently
yes i think that i am full of expectations
challenge statements or policies that cause them professional concern
i have been having collaborative learning at least once a week during the last two months
first
sometimes i had some points that can not be understand better i would raise my hands and lecturers always help me resolve those difficulties as soon as possible i can feel their enthusiasm and positive attitude which make me impression
the academic atmosphere of york university is also very strong
i think good students have to be defined in two ways
these examples were based on true innovative technology or stories
but in uk there has thedifferent educational model student not only need to listen hard in the classbut also need to read a large number of books to research the information whichstudents need and summary it to write many essays and reports
lecturers do not need notes to remind themselves of the content of their presentations and each lecturers presentation is highly skilled
the major difference is the workload id say
and look at the article and video recommended by the teacher
since i went to primary school i have already formed the habit of studying the content of class in advance
althoughstudents lecture and lecture lecturer is different students tend to lectureto introduce a general thing but the instructors lecture i will appropriatereference stylepreparenotes five or six small pages of notes what can help me to explain logicallyand answer audience questionslocation areasonable location for the audience to hear clearly and make eye contact withthemselvesthe speedof speech helps the audience to adapt and understand the content
yes im pleasantly surprised with some subjects because at first there where some subjects i didnt know much about them and then after the induction week i liked them more
strategic management of engineeringmanagement shows that a thoughtful view of the legal form of the organizationhow the statement of mission and vision reflects and generates corporate valueand how specific strategic directions policies and practices are generated
in the end this way of taking notes was inefficient and wasted a lot of my time and energyi have groped out the right way for me to take notes until last year
kind of learning9
similarities can help us have some same ideas and differences can help us be more objective
so far i have found these to be mostly successful
can not balance study and life2
from the collaborative learning in a group i acknowledge that it can be more effective or it can also be timewasting which is dependent on how we team members collaborate together
thankfully most are sociable which i find is one of the most helpful criterias for collaborative work
here we just have 3 or 4 modules running at the same time and i can spend much more time in each one to understand better the content and prepare the assessments
as for the possible test questions i think they are all in the keywords
if lecturers stand at the same site and no body languages audience will feel too boring to stay here
i think when a big topic is given to a speaker firstly，they usually take into account that im covering a wide range of topics or expanding on a particular area
although it is not a common situation however there are always someone never listening to others
i have seen many types of the presentation some of them given by teachers can be really interesting but most of them given by our students can be boring or terrible
absent no teamwork no punctual work hard brave not shy they work hard and want to show others their results whenever good or bad
expecting the next steps others will takepaying attention to others microexpressions
i took a huge leap from 56 to 75
i do think i can work following the principles during my taught msc and in my working life as an engineering manager
i have more knowledge about the chinese culture
after class i actively participated in the group discussion and made suggestions for our group work
in the university of york students have vle which can provide a platform to prereview and find the recording of courses
i hope that i also can think independently and express my opinions bravely
instead of using slides dr issitusually brings up his topic with some key words on word document
it is far beyong my expectation
aactually i have been in york studying for four months and i have to say that i love the city and the university
at this time cooperation and communication between each sectors were indispensable which determines the quality of a project
at another situation i also display thebad habit that prevent me from being a distinction grade student
in the context ofselfcriticism this is wronganother negative aspect is lazinesslaziness is that characteristic that many people have because they have ahappy life and the warm growing environment that their parent have providedso they lose little enthusiasm for hard work and indulge themselves
from previous experiences of group work i have also seen the importance organise the distribution of work in order to be able to make effective use of the whole groups time
some modules are entirely new to me
i already tell them but i do not think it is very important for our team
this will allow students to become more familiar with the future work of this major
to be honest during my undergraduate studies more than reading from a book my inclass notes has always been helpful and sufficient in understanding the concepts
maybe we lack of communicationor just the team have no communicate with others
in the class i saw a lot of students listening to the lectures very carefully
they are so confident that they can deliver the lecture freely
even if everyone has their own opinions we can still accomplish the required tasks very wellthey can give me a lot of opinions and find that my shortcomings make me better
not just understand whatyou learn we also need to know some professionalrelated knowledge to enrichour skills
i have had a great time in the two months of studying in york
talk with all group members frequently4
and never worried to give your own opinionit may can help your friends a lot
the library has single study rooms and it  s open 24 hours
alongside that i was friends with several msc students from last year which gave me the chance to see what the course is like together with getting some opinions
i can think more logically and manipulate knowledge whin real cases together
definitely i feel that if we listen to each other and try to understand the meaning there is not challenge
the chores themselves are not poor choices but rather the lack of time management on my off hours is a poor choice as it leaves me no time or energy to be productive with academic work
many of them try to give a example that they have encountered in their life before so that helps us really well
i am not sure if my english level can support my professional class and want to learn
i have some bad habits for example i often delay my timetable sometimes i made some timetable for myself what time to have a dinner what time to study in the library or what time to watch english movie but it does not work all the time
i think i can work to these principles during my taught msc
it is very clearly to see the sources of the pictures when placing them in the slide in all the programme
weoften study together discuss the focus of each session and prepare a lot of presentationswe share knowledge and brainstorm
2nd collectivism absolutely is chinese character about this i think this feature is probably due to the population of china the giant amount of people make them have to separate in many group and part
actually i think my learning efficiency in the dormitory is lower thanlearning in the library
i always pursue perfection
for the course of enterprise some background knowledge that i see is from journal and some articles
the process of taking notes is a process of positive thinking
here are some factors which caused unsuccessful collaborative learningwork independentlymany students strongly prefer to work alone and they are feeling uncomfortable by having to work in groupscommuting problem commuter students often have difficulty finding mutually acceptable times for group meetingsirresponsibilitysome students are simply irresponsible fail to do their share of the assigned work and leave the rest of the group to deal with the irresponsibilityoverconfidence studentssuperior students often resent having to carry weak or lazy students and worry that their grades will be lowered by having to work with such studentspartition of assignmentpartition of the work among team members means that no one does every step of the assignment so no one completely understands the entire exercise
but i hope we can have more tutorials with our supervisor
studying all courses by english is difficult for me3
foster success1 listen to lecturers carefully in the classes2
i think using humour in classes is quite excellentsome suggestions are belowfirst i think if the teachers can use more transitions it can be quite useful for students to move one point to the next
i personally think i can get on my study well i have already got used to the teaching style here1studying in university of york pays more attention to the ability of teamwork2lecturers pay more attention to the cultivation of students ability3students have more time to do what they like4many tasks are done in small groups5vle helps us to see the ppt and replay of the lecture6lecturers at university of york like to interact with students in class7we have many presentations to show our ability8the library of the university of york has many resources for us to use9if you dont understand something you can communicate with the teacher by email after class10the accommodation environment is also different
teachers wish us to ask some questions in class
however sometimes the majotity of the duty is allocated to only a few people as a result only a few people get trainings and improved while other people get almost nothing3
as a result i need to spend more time to catch the study program and lost more time to do other meaningful things
to be honest there were many background knowledge i could see in some subjects like the law for engineering management
the lectures for management amp marketing of technology flow smoothly from one topic to the next by showing the students a timetable with which week of the term covering what topic
never be selfish
other teachers also make jokes at times to liven up the atmosphere or explain difficult conceptsmy teachers really helped me move from one point to the next
these citations as the evidence of the research made the lectures more professional and convincing
we can do better and find more advantage from others and do better even the best in our programme
before comming to the university of york i spent some time investigating about the msc and its courses
no not at all
every employee is obligated to comply with the laws of the city province region and country in which the company operates
therefore if student wants to use these in their talk the first thing needs to do is understanding these concept first
i think the cooperative skills are important for successful collaborative learning
as stated above one of the most important factors in collaborative learning is the ability to effectively communicate
however there are some active behaviours of my classmates either
if they find it can not achieve their respective requirement theymay ask other members to modify over and over again
the main concern about the programme is the language barriers that are presented with the different cultures each of the students come from
besides due to different growth environment it is not easy to trust others totally to do some work assigned
as you move through your course you  ll be able to develop relationships with them through onetoone lectures and even connect with their own industry contacts
i think the international business is a large challenge for me because this is my first time to learn it
it didnt surprised mei were happy with this inductioni learned a lot
presently i think that im in a fantastic group
to enhance the atmosphere of the classroom
it may sounds quite silly but indeed it happened
they study hard and play hard
i think i can do it
i feel that that this programme is very focused on the management aspect as compared to the engineering aspect which other universities offer in their engineering management
in other hand they also choose the topic which is strongly relevant to the trend of development because the knowledge we learnt must be useful
in addition when i make the slides i will give evidence to support all my opinion which can make my lecture more professional and persuasive
but when i study in the course i dont have enough time to use mind mapping
while we working together we should come up ideas to achieve coordination and logical thinking
at the end of the coursewe will assign tasks to us as needed
of course i want to be a distinctiongrade student i hope i can have a good ending of my student life
in myopinion everyone has their own advantages this way of learning lets us learnthe advantages of others and then improve ourselves
making the lecture more interesting as a result
i think that in most of the lectures even when the lecture has an specific title and presents the topic to be covered in the lecture it would be great that at the begining of the lecture the teacher dedicates a couple of minutes offering a brief overview about the agenda to be covered in the lectureit could help in get the attention of the students in a very efficient way
as a foreign student many people have problems with speaking parts
therefore we can focus on the key points once we see the slides
therefore we should learn the useful presentation skills via observing our teachers presentation
for the courses of management and marketing of technology and msc personal effectiveness and masterclasses the lecturer is dr bidyut
i wanted to have some time to read some books at night but the music and various laughter sounds came out of the window which made me unconsciously give up the idea of ​​learning
make me confident
as atechnical beginner i also had to spend a lot of extra time to supplement theknowledge of other disciplines which were necessary to experiments
more feedback
the tour of the department seemed very helpful to new students however and all the socials were a great opportunity to meet new colleagues
tony introduces the uks various legal institutions and operating rules
but weve know each other for one week so i dont know much about their strength and weakness
so at the beginning there will be some unfamiliar and do not understand
libraryis a good place to study because comparing with chinese library universityof york library is 24 hours opening
law for engineering managementgoodmarketing of technologygoodmanagement of technoloygoodinternational businessgoodenterprisegoodstrategy managementgoodmsc personal effectiveness and masterclassesgood
im really surprised about the enthusiasm of our classmates
and he told me about my problems
engineering cost is more practical while engineering management is more theoretical which is the first difference between them
in my opinion most of lecture materials are explained in reading materials and slideshows
yesno
todays technology is developing with each passing day
after class i will playback and look what i can not understand
and our teachers barely use english to give us lecture thetext books are chinese as well
in this way i can finish the review more efficiently3
in order to learn more the pressure is also improved
each person has their own thoughts if communicate improperly it will become argument
employees should be aware of and comply with all laws and regulations that correspond to their position in the company
of course i can
challenges are likely to be keeping my professional knowledge and skills up to date and minimising both actual and potential negative effects for our succeeding generations etc
more detailed score than standard7elearning settings help me summarize and reflect on a weekly basis8
because they can recommend very useful and newest booksand article10
however those teams that have their own opinions
so so may be i am not sure
if there is someone on your team who does not know how to compromise their stubbornness may be hindering the overall productivity and morale the result would cause failurereliable and consistentcollaboration requires trust and trust comes from reliability and consistency
i search the information from news papers as well as the financial reports from company website
i was looking forward to the teamwork and communication with study colleges
i think it may because people in the group can not reach an agreement
the books required are relevant to the class even at the textbook level4 supervisionin chinese class teachers will call the roll for each class which is a form of checkin
most of my classmates are chinese so many times we are used to communicating with each other in chinese
besides i like to hangout with my friends and i think i spend too much time in sports
it also mixed in elements of the research process eg
there are lots of ways to record such as the cornell method the charting method and so on
they show us the slides before the class begin in the lecture they introduce a little contents which in the slides and add some information
therefore i love the teaching style in the uk and finland because i will have some initiative and voice in the classroom develop thinking through some interesting group interactions and so on
the slides were clear which is helpful for me to reviewevery lecturer had good interaction and eye contact with us they tried to take care of everyone and usually asked us whether we understand what they said or have some questionsthey also had some essential blackboard writing to explain something
i remember when i was doing my bachelors i had multiple amount of kept back subjects after every term
maybe they are very good at studying and doing musical things which can help them to succeed in this course
and i suggested him that he should take steps to avoid some dangerous so he applied rebuild it to relevant company and engineer
the friendly relationship between classmate surprises me
efforts are something that many people can do but imagination and creativity are not for everyone
they are all people with talents and very friendly
for example he likes use trump to represent stupidity and german to make some jokes
yes none
cooperate responsibilityonly if the group members all own strong cooperate responsibilities and they all want to make contributions to group
after everydays lecture i need to walk 20 mins to home and i am more willing to watching some videos or movies to relax
there also be some students who never cares what has been mentioned in the lecture
so i change my method
and listening carefully in the class finishing assignments in time
it is quite the same with presessional class
to be honest now i do not familiar with my groupmate so after some time i will get the answers
they also use simple words as much as possible and try their best to express ideas clearly
from the induction we all have our own team i think we did really good until now
team work ，good communication and cooperation might be three important factors for successful collaborative learning
i think this kind of activity is useful for us
we could decide how to present the assessments as long as they coverthe topic at issue8 student life there is a lot of support to have plentyof activities to complement the student life
i have learned much from collaborative learning i think it will affect my whole study or work life in the future
put forward different opinions on the basis of careful observation and analysis of othersspeeches or operations affirm the correct side of their opinions and criticize the wrong side lay out facts and reason in order to convince people
the amount of content is suitable not too much and not too less and the difficulty of each lecture can be seen gradually increased
second i think there are some cases where there are too many words on the slide
but as time goes i become a little lazy to finish it
john is a lecturer who is very humorous he always makes some jokes or tell us something interesting
usually people need time to consider whether their choice is correct
things could be better such as time management and organization but things were going smoothly for the most part
the different teaching method i was taught in a small class during my first degree there were 50 students in one class mostly
first of all i think that we need to be confident and stand in front of everyone
tutors and lectures use different styles and methods to teach us and evaluate our assessments6
if i ask some questions that they dont know well they will tell you directly they are not sure and then explore it with students after class
after the induction i think that group collaboration is very important in process management
these are what i will take from the lecturer and use ourself when i give a talk
having previously studied a bsc at ucl the class sizes were much bigger and the lectures much longer
no matter where i sit in the classroom i can clearly hear the teachers voice and their voice is full of emotions
it is only occasionally interrupted by the whispereddiscussions of other studentslecturemost of the lecturers have no notes because most of the theories are easy tounderstand but they will actively participate in the explanation andsupplement it appropriately
basically the principle creative the firstthe last thing i learnt on the youtube us leave my phone my ipad my computer only
i am chinese and i worked with chinese
some people like to listen to the teacher directly while others like to take notes while listening
the degree feels a lot harder and requires much better planning and preparation it is hard to accept that i need to reduce my side activities such as guitar and judo in order to focus on my degree as they are all very essential to me as a personconsidering all of the above i am currently working on myself by setting early deadlines for individual tasks in order to manage everything
personally i think is that everyone has own thought but no good discussion to figure out
it is my pleasure to study dse at york university
as for my academic performance i think there is still a lot of room for improvement
speak loudly3
two membersof the group quickly agreed
i am very interested in the setting of the course content
yes the way to study is different from that i thought before
the lecturers taught me lots of ways to improve my skills
i can help them find the best part of their ideas，mix them up，and get the mos t suitable idea for the goal
in my group everyone is creative and is good at implementing the plan we are all positive to share our ideas
they have followed their weekly syllabus
human being is not designed to be flawlesswe make all kind of poor judgement and do stupid things
afterschool life is also different
and i am very willing to help them if they need
in the university of york the library is available 24 hours actually really convenient for students3selflearning ability
of course i did not win at the endwhen i saw others win the prize i was disappointedthen i began to reflect on why i did not work harder at first
i feel that my ability to take notes is very poor
well it is what im looking forward to
but in uk the final exam can be divided into several parts not only the final report
for each session teachers have been fully prepared regarding courseware preparation and case analysis before class
the much interaction was surprised me the class atmosphere is goodand everybody has involved in the class
combined the suitable utilization of clear powerpoint lecturers could clearly express the gist and important information of the topic to us
absolutely yes
the third is that textcitations
in that case we can discover conflicts easily and solve these problems as fast as we can to avoid negative consequences
i like the lecturer enthusiasm and way of learning by slides and encouraging videos
after graduating from the university i chase my master degree here directly and i did not join into any job i just took part in an internship related to the bank and due to i am just the trainee of the bank i donnot need to make any decision of the bank
the lecture notes of international business are presented in word format listing each point and giving a detailed introduction to the content of a class but it seems a bit messy
the contents of this page should be used as the agenda and notes for the meeting
because if i dont know that i will have no motivation to finish it perfectly
for some open questions they will analyze for us first and provide one or two suitable suggestions for references
so here are ten different things i have listed1 the style of the class is different
when i act as the leader of the team i divided the task into several part and we focused on small part every meeting
the main difference is the way to complete a task and opinion on priority of tasks
in my opinion being on time is important in any situation
frankly speaking i was a little nervous that i can not understand english very well by lecturer when i started the first class however i can not believe that i could understand bidyut very well
most of the time we decided what we learned and what we learned
appropriate use of physical presentations or videos can be used when expressing the main content which will adjust the atmosphere and ease the tired audience
in the end everything becomes urgent
the unsuccessful collaboration is also due to the difference between each persons way of thinking and learning habits which will cause disputes between the members
in addition in group cooperation it is necessary to balance the group members who speak more and speak less and balance the rights and relationships between the team members so that each team member can share their feelings gains and suggestions
yes i can learn some professional knowledge of both engineering and management
however i think that is not a good reason
it is essential for successful collaborative learning to do the three things
in terms of curriculum arrangement yorks courses are morescattered giving us more time to reflect on our own and studying independently 2
maybe someone feeling good about himself
i hope to correct my shortcomings and improve my english to get a distinction
i have really enjoyed the lectures in terms of both the content and the delivery of them
another reason may be short of time whatever before the meeting or during it
we will help each other work together and promote each other
for instance i could just feel like not wanting to have anything to do with my studies for a period and would not be doing something productive as well
i can also give advice to them at the same timei think the most important thing in collaborative learning is that the division of labor is clear and you can listen to others opinions
even if my question is not very worthwhile i can get the answer
i think the scope of the course is just right
people dont rush to work but pay attention tothe beauty of life
when a tall chinese boy answered the question his performance was very confident which made his answer more convincing
i learned about market analysis financial statements swot analysis etc
e can play more team games to improve relationships
i hope that there will be more interaction between the tutor and the students
i think my classmates spoken english are very wellthe topics of my classmates communicated with teachers in the class are very novel
therefore they will gain the different results
he always want to us to win every assignment
weifan and yifan worked very hard in order toreduce the expenses
i have to admit that i cant meet the standard it makes up
i saw one of my classmate she always printed the document that teacher put in vle before the class
i think have the passion and enthusiastic is such importanthelping my teammate and share skill to everyone is a good idea i hope i could have a great success in collaborative learning in the future
but negative treatment of problems and learning will suffer failure
my friends as well as my classmates are good at cooperating with others and critical thing which i feel will foster success
plus bidyut is teaching this module really wellstrategy i love this module a lot as it helps me think in a more innovative way
i think maybe different people has different thoughts in my opinion the lecturers they all have their own thoughts on the way they taught
in my learning process the environment is a more important factor for me
i knew the other way to take notes is mind mapping
1
hao wang and i both have worked a few years before we come here the others never worked but their hachelor degree is more close to engineering management than mei think we are still not knowing each other enough and we can collaborate much better after we tudy together for a few months
yesi feel satisfitied about the teaching style nowbecause we have more chance to interact with tutorsin the pastthe tutor would taught something that we should did and told us the answer directly
i believe the life is fantastic and the following challenge for me is to try my best to balance study and life
in addition at the strategic management lecture jo told us about the 4th industrial revolution and so on
double lectures can be quite a handful and it tends to be difficult to keep focus into the second hour especially when the content is very advanced
collaborate study plays an important role in my study now
selflearning is the key to our good study
hinder success some people in my group hardly went to class
the task pays more attention to therigor of internal logic9
second we should respect the way others work
personally i think thisis where i need to improve now
my questions so far have been successfully answered with more than a noyes answer
lectures delivery is composed into lectures workshopsseminar and laboratory for the core modules which runs from monday to friday
during the last month i have learned how to handle the academic work in the university
in my case i have a more artistic background with a music bachelor and i was afraid of the more mathematical subjects
it is hard to doubt the authority
the lecture was delivered in an understandable way except the course of law for engineering management
i think i can practice how to show my own thought and how to negotiate with others
i dont take notes often
so that we can get the highest efficiency and learn more
international students studyingabroad are usually faced with two problems one is slowly into the society itwas one of those special personality open like dealing with all kinds ofpeople of that kind of but because it is in foreign country need a strong oralenglish ability and the ability to sense motive this for general just forstudents studying abroad is limited after all is one of the few the secondis that due to the difficulty in integrating into this exotic circle i willslowly close myself up
in the second time i talked a lot about things that i havent talked about at the first time and they were very important
basically me and one other partner were incharge to do all the work
but now we understand and know more about us i think our cooperation in team will be better
one of the initial purpose of collaborative learning is to improve the efficiency of work but sometimes the poor communication may result in low efficiency of team work
the way of thinking has changed in my bachelor degree we do not lay emphasis on critical thinking6
i think the most important thing for me is to improve spoken english because it is useful for my future career when i graduate after this year and i need to improve my professional skill about engineering management and have the courage to talk in the class
in the past studies teachers rarely interacted with students
what he or she think about this topic
success is always reserved for those who are prepared
i think that isunfair for that group members and it would be dangerous if the hardworkingpeople make some wrong decisionthird i would be better if members have differentskills
if i can encourage others to do things or create better interests in teamwork i will be a success manager
this made me not confident i did not know what i should say
before the introduction i always thought the course might be boring
but i still cant admit that i am adistinction grade student
once i achieve these small goals i will feel a great sense of accomplishment which will encourage my morale
this should be the biggest problem i have encountered
learned time management in this group assignment
so if a group has a very good communicating environment it will help collaborative learning more successful
and i do like the group activities they preparedwhich would help us to understand the course better
although i feel it is difficult for me to change it is good for me to have a habit in the future
all courses here are all my need in my work
in thisquestion i personally believe that reflecting on my own wrongdoing can help mesucceed
during the progress of this course some general knowledge will be taught and we have the chance to do the practice via the elearning log
on the other hand if we communicate effectively with each other we can clearly identify their suggestions and sometimes these suggestions are very helpful for the total team work
the course is fun and has a good interaction
on the other hand i see some students playing games during classes in the classroom and they dont listen to teachers and concentrate themselves on games
different people are good at different field
and also it  s hard for me to share projects or share tasks with others because i always believe that i can do it all and asking for help will be seen as a sign of weakness
everyone has hisher own schedule so thatsometimes the group meeting time might be hard to be settled down
i wont finish my homework or organize my study plan very quickly
different from chinese education universitys education in york focuses on selfdirected learning and teamwork
i think academic writing session and team competitions are very helpfuli think academic writing and team competitions are very helpful
firstly nervous i am the most perfect person to do everything and i want to do the best so most of time i am particularly nervous and worried that i am not doing well
it encourages me to ask more questions in the future
we should get used to the english environment more and more
collaborative learningis an ideal way of learning for me
it is beneficial to the group working
i always think taking notes is one of the problems for me
mot there are many new technology examples such as tesla dyson etc to introduce the definition of the management and marketing of the technologylaw there are many true cases delivered by the lawyer which make the boring and complex statues much easier to understand for uspersonal effectiveness and masterclasses there are many useful skills and real exampleswhich give us guidance to implement useful working skills such as word powerpoint etcenterprise there are many useful skills of how to start a small business which is helpful for us to run our own business in the future
besides most lecturers are alway famous especially john and i can understand clearly and quickly
when i encounter a problem and need a teacher to solve the problem the teacher will explain it patiently explain it to me in a very easytounderstand language and give some examples to help me understand the problem
when there is anemergency i would reschedule my time
in so doing we begin to create our ownunique conceptual frameworks and not rely solely on an experts or a textsframework
when a team have differents ideas we need to talk with each other and decide a good idea to do it together
describeyour strategy for reading and understanding the text of the course
i think positive communication is an important factor for success
at the same time i concentrated on the lectures
besides that if we have other group assignments inthe future lecture we also need to study as a team
although i am a bit worried that i cant finish tasks very well i believe i will do my best
if you don  t manage yourthings right you would become less efficient and chaotic
because often in collaborative learning each person is faced with different tasks it is important to report what has been done and understand the results of others
she was also unable to complete the assigned tasks on time or efficiently which led to the increase of other peoples workload
as i mentioned textbook plays a important role in chinese education
however i find other always say and i also joined in
the leader is the core of the whole team
even a image they will mark the resources below the image
this is the wrong choice to make in the case of playing
if i am the team leader of a task i will listen to each members opinions and seek the best solution to the problem
there are more interaction than i expected
compared with this now i listen to the lecturer in english which is a small challenge to me anyway and the teaching style here is flexible and variable
with their support i will be more confident to complete my studies in the university of yorkit will be harder and harder to learn in the next few weeks while i have confidence in myself and my group members
in this way i can save much more time to concentrate on class and dont lost important knowledge
professor will give some reading lists in last week
i was very confidence after the first class and i can also learn better in other coursestrategic of em is my favourite course because dr jo north is significantly interesting and activity in class
everything is very well the course meets my expectations and the digital design course is very interesting it is worth taking the time to learn
iwill attend every lecture and never doing something unrelated such as playingthe phone or chatting with other classmates
i can maintain concentration in listening
we are usually requested to have a discussion and then show our ideas which is quite different from always being quiet and listening to the lecture in chinai am trying to participate in the interactions
another essential factor is good time management as this will allow for enough solo study to enable one to make sufficient contributions to the group in joint sessions and not doing so will cause the entire burden to be on others
and the replayed video or audio can also help me in review the important details and supplement the missing point of my noteseventually i found the efficient note taking method suit for me appropriately
most of the lectures or has a complete knowledge structure is easy to make me a little understand the contents of the need to understand such as the introduction of the communication this course before i learn is web design and programming the signal of knowledge does not understand or even completely dont understand so need to be more careful in this course lucky is a professor in the process of this course for some of the detail of the key words and formulas about are carefully will be simple to separate physical concepts and mathematical formulapersonally i am more accustomed to this way of teaching
i like using evision very much and i also like that i can play back the content of my tutors class after class to help me review better
but here i can get some interesting points and dont need to worry about exam
this is going to be in the spring term
in addition i have to say that teacher prepared the class very carefully and interesting6
then go to the basis of this evidence to find the corresponding course materials for review
and i think the teacher of bityut do best on the lecture help of moving from one point to the next
some students usually show great curiosity to the point which is given by the professor
mutual understanding is critical becauseonly when one can understand another can information be conveyed in theexpected way
the dream is to study here
in my bachelor degree the teachers spread knowledge while in york lecturers enlighten you and you should put forward by yourselves2 environment
i have to be as prepared as they are
when i gave a speech the most useful thing i could learn from the lecturer was selfconfidence
longterm orientation suits for chinese i think thats good but need to take care of the plan when we achieve our target6th china is an ancient country in the world history so the culture of china fills with the good manner and politeness
furthermore he is very rigorous and precise
at same time i know the reference is very importantthe difference 1 in china listen to class is a simple way to study
when agreeing on the number of meetings andmeeting time we often need to make some compromises with our leisure timewhen discussing different issues different people hold different opinions
i am very excited about the time of the year
however efficient learning in class is the most important part
atthis time there are often some heated arguments
by contrast there are too many contradictory things when they finish their respective assignments
we need to put ourselves in anothers shoes and ask more questions about why instead of just fighting and bickeringthe perspectivetakinga team has some decisions such as meeting held because group number more than three people even some team have eight people then the meeting time is a contradictory point everyone has their own life so to learn empathy inch sometimes needs everyone to achieve team wants to get the resultsefficientas i mentioned above the bucket effect what we need is everyone to compete actively do well and help those who do poorly to promote the completion of the task actively
this is because i can  t control the time take time in my own hands or simply don  t realize the importance of timewhen i recall what i did yesterday and the week what inspired
it can make us more efficient in the studying
i think most challenges may come from two aspects
i think the most essential thing is the sense of responsibility
it is really a great teaching style that i prefer
all in all there are many differences between oriental and occidental cultures
not only that in the communication everyone needs to actively participate in the courage to communicate
first i can learn the logical order of the presentation from them
this sometimes brings conflicts to the team members
thats can be quite a good idea for our freshman
besides lecturers alway introduced and showed the content to us about this lecure before beginning to start lecture
members academic performancecognitive ability and methods should be basically the same
i was really angry to find that some of the team members did not finish the task but they do have the time to do the travelling and cooking
icame to york to concentrate on my professional knowledge instead of travelingthough i have these problems i am gradually correcting them
in his lecture waseasy to move from one point to otherbidyut baruah flows logically in his lectures
for instance teacher use many examples to prove the theory or use examples to explain the theory which can help international students have a deeper understanding in academic fliedsecondly teachers use mircophones to ensure everyone can hear the voicethirdly appropriate communication make me feel more sense of participation for the classes
the activity most helpful i think is the meeting of group supervisor
its hard to get complicated by getting the understanding of others and letting others listen
and then i can finish the homework or academic works better
i will share the keys i learned in lectures with my friendsand they also will do thatwhen i meet some questions i cant figure out i will ask my friends or classmates for helpevery week i will have a knowledge sharing with my friends or teammates
for example in the course of introduction and communication
i hate myself to delay the original timetable over and over again
i am eager to be agood student but i think i have procrastination
i am not good enoughto be successful in one experiment i had to spend a lot of time to debug
i admire their talent of actor because i canunderstand very well the message they are transmitting to me
your results are combined together so that you have to be conscious of part of the assignment which is in charge of you
when i review them i will combine my notes with the slides or the text books
and then speaker would use some digital circuit design as example and evidence to teach audience how to apply these knowledge
and they usually take some notes ask some questions to the lecturers
studentneed not pay any money when they take 66 number bus to go to the campus place
in the world there are so many cultures
therefore the groups strength can not be ignored
i am an engineering student i have a lot ofexperiments to do and many experimental reports to write
as i said before everyone think they are correct but the fact is everyone is wrong
i think the teachers presentation can serve as a standard for my personal presentation
yesi didnt except that we would have team activities in the induction programme
additionally the lecturer is well acquainted is humorous open for questions even when people are asking a lot kind
so i can understand mynotes well
when i turned to get something i accidentally knocked the glass on the table
the question is do you aspire to be a distinction grade studenti think of course i want to be a grade student
the lecturers sometimes play the jokehave you even seen the students less than less
they are absolutely good examples of ppt models for us to learn from
almost everyone wants to be a distinction grade student so i must take much more time than other students and do more reading about expertise
to sum up if i read some article in my leisure time i use mind mapping
because i can fall asleep easily here so that i will be full of energy in the next day
i will get the guidance from each professor and complete assignments together with other team members
these are the differences between em masters degree at york and my undergraduate degree more independent more thoughtful critical thinking more like reading more quiet like group discussion make new friend
some people do really well some people not
if he dont hear it clearly hell ask to repeat it or say it in a different way to make sure its true
sometimes i think what i did has covers many aspect and there could be a throughout analysis to a project or a topic
there is a painful lesson because i am lazy it is happened on weekend i originally wanted to finish my homework and review this weekend but a new game was came in the same day i couldn  t overcome the idleness and started play the game and i want to do my plan after 1 hours
the third thing i learn is do some creative things in the morning and check email or social after lunch
i will try my best to solve and put out ways to ensure these challenges will not become problems
i think we should communicate with each other to show our opinion and solve the discrimination together
however after these four days introduction i can understand how many modules are going to be taught to us
but sometimes i felt lazy and sluggish
i think every lecture is logical and easy to follow lecturer may organize their lecture well and sometimes the lecturer would use humour but maybe because of different culture background i can not get that kind of humour
i am quite happy for this two months in york1more teamwork with our supervision group members our group do a lot of teamwork for our enterprise and international business2need more selfregulation of learning student need to study autonomically and nobody will urge you to do some things3need to search more resources to complete homework when i want to finish my essay i need to search a lot of information from the internet4treat each homework more serious and try my best 5practice speaking and writing skills in english we have several presentations and some essay homework6correct some bad habits7become more confident 8meet more friends from different countries
this is a bad behaviour people usually believe they still have time so they spending time on socializing going out to travel or playing games
i havent done any serious violations but ive lied to people and made some pollution to the environment
the induction helped me to know what is my course and what i will learn in this whole year
i did find that some sessions where somewhat unnecessary at masters level
the member in our team has different character and different skills that can makes our team get a lot of improvement
ive always thought that proper humor in class is the best way to keep students focused
the second must attract the attention of the audience such as guiding the audience in a humorous way and increasing interaction with the audience
after coming to york the time management is long span of time andthere is a lot of free time every dayalthoughi have a plan each week but the implementation is not good
however i know that i will improve first myself and secondto them
my team has two mates from different countries at the start of this week there were a lot of different witch i can not accept and understand for example different culture different thinking
for example the publictransport is underdeveloped
for leaning style except much collaborative learning there is no big difference between the past and the present
i have learned from other lecturers the the powerpoint is very important
for the problem solving individual  s perspectives are usually not comprehensive but everyone can learn from each others strengths and find the best solution through good communication
now is the proper time to change to learn to reject the temptation in life thinking carefully about what i want to gain in this whole year and what i need to pay changing my life into what i want making the similar decision as i have made when i was an undergraduate student
something are relate with the academic work like reading all the prematerials before every lecture reading all the reading lists learn another foreign language etc
after two months in york i became more and more accustomed to the life and study herewhat pleased me most was that i had made several good friendsso generally speaking i had a good time here
in my former study i have never used this system
the first and most important point is that the biggest feeling i have had in our group for one semester is that everyone respects the ideas of others
most of the students are now speaking skills and skills professional knowledge and critical thinking and teamwork skills5
once i asked some questions about the method of postgraduate study my tutor explained it in detail and recommended some bibliographies which helped me a lot
i think that the lectures have generally been delivered well
what i learned from the lecturers was that what i am going to say should be logical fluent clearand i should be confident and decent in speech and my voice should be heard by everyoneits best to be able to interact with the audience
in addition i can also accurately write the citation format which is undoubtedly very importantfor the engineering management courses im taking now some of them are a bit of a struggle for me
in my mind the only thing that i repeat thati can i can
although the time for class is less than before i spend more time on study
the ethical principles mentioned in this statement are not a rule but a normal logical value
i think behaviors like this are not good for us
normally the student focus on listening to the lecture the main content is included in what lectures talking about
of course i sometimes get distracted by my phone
as i have mentioned before the induction programme is quite helpful and useful and i am quite satisfied about it
as we can imagine everyone in the group has hisher personal thoughts and they are almost different in the biginning
this paved the way for the study of detailed engineering regulations that followed
no advice
in the beginning many students still preview the next days class contents but recently the week feels that their attitude is not so positive
some are arent as comfortable talking in english which makes it hard to put points across and also takes longer to get to a solution
i will make friends with the foreignpeople to improve my communication ability in english
therefore i really admire their teaching attitude
no i havent
i also believe that planning an approach to each semesters assignments well in advance will also give the greatest chance of success
the content scope of law for engineering management is clear but relatively difficult to understand
of course i sometimes use ipad to take notes with apple pencil in which case i can directly modify and mark the focus on the teachers ppt
there is a temporary leader in ourgroup every week
i havent copied any academic work and i am devoted to being a distinction grade student however i think my bad habbits and poor english are preventing me from being a distinction grade student
ithink this bad habit also would discourage me to be a grade student
we talk about how much we miss our home allthe time and news related to the civil war crisis keep pop out
however the selection of key articles has become a necessary skill for students2 the systemin the class in china some universities im not sure how many can use electronic devices to take notes in class but most universities are not allowed to use computers mobile phones and other products in class
to improve interpersonal relationships participate in school activities learn more people and learn from them5
i think i still have many problems before i become a distinction student
actuallysometimes in classy think some knowledge points can be recorded in a sentence then the record is concise and to the pointbut when i review after classy will find that some knowledge points need to be recalled carefullyin my past experience of taking notes could not make a mechanical copy of the content on the teachers coursewarei had to listen carefully and then make notes with my own words after understandingthe notes on each page should not be too full and should be left with a certain amount of blank space to supplement after class with ideas about their own thinking or new knowledge points obtained from research
1 disharmony in the team
i think the possible problems is the language barrier try to explain what you want to say and have any questions just askthese two principles can solve the problems
i understand the content of the each course
they always use slides but sometimes they may write some notes in the blackboard
for me its not easy to take notes and listen english in the same time
we need feedback and thinking instead of makingup stories
i like the belbin test but i think it needs some changes
in the asian college seems to be a classroom people just walk in for the class and get out they wont spend time in the school library in york is so amazing it creates a perfect area for student study i love york library39 vle one of best in my life we can see a lot of information on vle the most astonishing point is video i can review the course every day every time so wonderfulfourth life in uk410 living in ukthe dormitory is so good but it costs a lot of money and the kitchen common room is impressive people love to chat with their friends there
i think the most challenging thing is to always keep innovation in knowledge
during my previous studies ive tried to take notes in several ways but ive never been a good note taker handwriting the main concepts trying to write all that the lecturer say or write etc now in york since ive seen that all the lecturers have very well designed slides im not taking notes in the traditional way
in my course text i also take notes by lists but my lists will star from main points and every main point will have different support points
because more time can be managed for postgraduate student it is easy to make myself relaxed in the free time
during these 2 months i learned a lot of knowledge that i never touched before
because these questions are very sensitive i hope that one day i can answer generously what is your nationality
i know it is a hard thingsi think we can finish our work by effective communication and make everyone do what they are goood at
when we write the report we try our best to require every word to be rigorous
i will change my current occasional class to see the chat software problem and solve it
sixth the concept of team learning was rarely mentioned during college
furthermore although i have been a student for about 20 years i still haven  t developed the habits that preview before class and review after class
besides the teamworks core is the common dedication
but they are essentially a profession
people can cooperate better when they know each other very well
one more suggestion if the slides can highlight some main words or explain some difficult concepts it must be very useful for students to preview and reviewwhat is more our teachers often use eyetoeye contact much and some interaction in our classesour teachers rarely use notes but i think it is ok because the slides can include all of the course contentsanother suggestion if all of our classes can be videotaped it can be really helpful for students to review our class contents
the second thing is i like playing games withmy friends
in china my first degree school didnt have a system like this10integration
and i think the cooperation is essential for successful collaborative learning
its easy to miss the time to submitmy sense of innovation is very poor
firstly i think we shoud have a fix time for meeting becasue we must work together to finish our homeworksecondlyi should improve my listening ability sometimes i can not understand speaker means
i strongly agree with and affirm this principleso i can work to these principle during my taught msc and in my working life as an engineering managerfirst i think the challenge will appear in the interests of companies and individualssome people will be confused by personal interests
because these transition words can attract peoples attentionsecond i think whether the teachers can give us the outline and main points before each class
in addition the handouts and ppt are all available in yorkshare vle we can download these documents before the lecture and combine what we have read with the key points listed in the handoutsppt to have a thinking or even to have a prediction to what our teacher will going to say
they use their humor and patiences to help us concentrate on their lecture
first of all i lacked patience in my life when i began my master studyat that time i wanted to go to the sport center to do physical exerciseeveryday
i found that the teaching style not only teaching us professional knowledge but also focusing on our career in the future which i think it will have good effect on finding a job
regarding the case of being a distinction grade student i really am not thinking of marks here
in the group discussion i gradually adapted to this learning style
regarding some assignments completed by our group this semester i think we have a severe problem of procrastination which is also fatal
secondly when some people put forward their opinions some team members feel that this view is not rigorous but for various original purposes they may not give timely opinions which will also lead to unsuccessful cooperation
during the class like international business dr john always communicated with us in their eyes adjusting the volume of the content to make the voice high and low ensuring that we can all hear clearly and attract our attention
fortunately after two months adaptation i really love the teaching style here and fit it quite wellthe main differences i found in the studying and teaching style are as listfirstly the traditional teaching style in china is that the teacher handle the time of the class all the time and seldom have the spare time for asking questions
sometimes we need to do a lot of reading to find evidence and materials to support our ideas which requires us to learn independently9
i think i can follow these principles during my taught msc and my career life
we dont feel much nervous or too relaxed everyday
the slides are very clear and i can hear the lecturer very clear
i tried to improve my reading speed and efficiency in the way that my teacher taught me
this type of model of study is really difficultfor me i have to use the new method to study i have to read many english booksand i need to summary it
yes that is great to me because when i studied cs as an undergraduate student most work were focus on code it was more like to talk to computer and a bit stubborn
i hope i can also improve those abilities through our collaboration
the knowledge will not perform well if we do not have enough experiences so i think lecturers can show us their experience to us
my personal approach is to only take notes on key pieces of information that i will not find in the lecture slides then to review the lecture slides after lecture to take notes that demonstrate my understanding of the subjecti have noticed that not all student attend every single lecture
in bidyuts lecture i fell very nice
the lectures for international business and law for engineering management are not so clear on what they are going to cover as the former jumps directly into a topic without it being clear on how the topics are going to help with the assignment and the latter with a different lawyer each week covering a different subject in a nonlecture approach this is understandable as the lawyers are not lecturers
i think that our teachers told us some important information such as doing a reference the structure of the program teamwork and so on
i think i should be more patient and inclusive
many ways can define the contentthe speaker can give audiences some example and discuss with themthe speaker also can introduce directly what they will speak
as such i have not encountered any problems while note taking but i can be a bit lazy sometimes during lectures
i may finish my homework one hour before the deadline
if i can get a role that is my strength or i was used to play in the group that would be efficient
i need try to response to the questions from teacher
because of not taking notes i have to review the reply to recall
even if there is a team member being lazy will seriously affect the progress of teamwork
in the last degree teachers generally do not require students to prepare for the class but require students to finish their homework carefully
he has not used note in his lecturesbidyut baruah i have heard very well and he often asked us if we couldhear him well
although i have tried to improve myself in this field i still cant change the situation
besides everyone has different requirement and standard to the sameassignment
some of them seem to have little life outside of university although this could just be because they dont talk to all of the other students in the class
i am sure that i am ambitious to be a distinction grade student when i received the offer from uni of york
instead of shouting out loud all the things you are good at it is better to talk about them or even better perform them when you are asked to
when we had aproblem with project i met with supervisors
1 determine team goals
the living environment is different
and our usual homework and attendance are also included in the final score6homeworkin york our homework is usually based on group work which requires team members to cooperate to complete
i know that i amworking with three different cultures
i think i can cope with most academic work well especially those i am interested
yes i hadwhen i was a intership in a construction sites in china i found that my leader allowed workers to do some professional work
the lecturer will make the content he wants to talk about the knowledge point of juxtaposition amalgamation and step by step so that we sound more logical
everyone tend to believe they are correct but actually not
and i create a useful mark system for me such as triangle means something i need to do or which is related to my assignment
maybe the lesson would be hard to understand at first but i think it will be fine if i work hard
this will give me time to prepare for the whole year
due to we have different specialty we can work in the area of our strengths can avoid the area of the weaknesses
their voices are clear and their pronunciation is pure which makes us not worried about listening
however by doing this discuss with the teammate can efficiently prevent making the poor decision
and the most challenge in my future career i think is that when i work as an employee of a company
because in the future work i will definitely have high percentage of leading a bad team
the most important thing in academic speech is to have a logical speech
in the future i would try my best to solveprocrastination and don  t be influenced easily and stick myself
to the contrary someone like to start the project first and start to study when they meets difficulty
therefore they cant engage in the work
although there are a lot of challenges i willkeep a good attitude to facing it i think the difficult will make me have asignificant improve i hope my english can have a big improve and i hope i canunderstand more speak more and can do the research easy than now
actually the teaching style is totally different from china but the teaching style is what i expected it should be
the style of the lecturers is what i like
besides that if theteachers give us some recommended books i usually would read them unless iforget them
our teachers always try to do some interaction with us but students still need to do more reactivities
in the masters study in the uk students are more likely to read and consult social resources which is diversified
the lecture which taught me how to use the library resources
the previous educational model and work experience have shaped my personal ability but also solidified my thoughts
moreover i will enjoy and learn more local culturesand euro cultures in my postgraduate study life
in the group work together i think the most important thing is the cultivation of team awareness
i usually take notes by colorful pens like red pen blue pen and general black pens
the members of our group are all very enthusiastic and each of them has their own strengths such as strong handson ability excellent organizational and leadership ability and also good at giving advice
i dothink that once i  m into the swing of work i  ll be able to do wellmy unproductive behaviour is putting off any reading until ihave to do it rather than planning it in advance i don  t like to read so i tendto procrastinate
talking about the poor choice to be honest i never think i have made any poor choice
but i feel that my english is not very good so i am worried about my ability to accept
however in the process of learning i think i am a student who is extremely eager for knowledge
and some other skills such as some bodylanguage academic ppt which are also very important to successfully built a presentation style
communicate the content of the class with me and remind me of the deadline of each class
i think it will become a stumbling block on my academic path
this is not seen in our country
however this can be resolves with experience and it is very early in the programme so both me and the international students can adapt and bond in order to produce effective results
besides the purpose of studying abroad is not to stay in the dormitory to play computer games or watch videos
the logic of lecture is well designed and it can gradually guide us from understanding the problem from simple to deepthe teachers are very humorous and active especially john
a useful site for technical contacts is linkedln we suggest but do not insist that you create a linkedln account and request a link with your supervisor and your supervision group members as a start to building a future personal technical networkenter on the form below the url of your linkedln profile or your favourite social media site note we will not contact you via facebook twitter or any other social media site unless you specifically invite us
however it is not so easy to achieve
oh
care for students timely understanding of their difficulties active enthusiasm patience to help students do not hurt their selfesteem help students to explain the causes of difficulties and solutionspersuade
i am pleasantly surprised about the programme and i am satisfied with it
therefore i think the belief and goals are important factors to succeedbesides some of students are likely to be late for class and absent to courses which will hinder success
i knew it was a taught msc but it really feels like the lecturers are willing to help as much as they can
they will be added separately at other times5
just one course of law may be a little difficult for chinese students to understand because there is a lot of professional vocabulary
if i have to chose one class is the most humorous it belongs to international business
all thecontent is connected with each other logically
the lectures were designed very well because its content is very attractive to usand the lecturers were humourous and let us laugh from time to timelast but not leastlectures always helped us move from one point to the next smoothlyif we have any questionsjust talk to the lecturesthey would answer us immediately
many behaviours can foster successfor example study hard communicate activity and good self control
yes i do have few concerns about program in this year because i do not have any experience in this style of study
their voice is loud and their pronunciation clear
i usually focus on the things which i think important the content which i am interested as well as the key content emphasized by the lecturer
adjust your emotions because your emotions may affect others
i am certain i can follow the principles during my study
there are some different opinions when we work together
as well i will try my best to undestand others opionion
yes all of teachers and staffs are quite kind and humorous
generally speaking i think the lectures were well delivered by our lecturers
i am enjoying each course becausethey are interesting
it took me quite a long time to cope with the studying style here
since the supervision group just include six students the teacher can communicate with students better
everybody has high level ofknowledge and skill
examples are given for important and difficult parts
all people were listening carefully and paying attention to me
xiaoli ma always concentrate on details and can point out some problems of the work
and i also use the markers or colored pens to highlight the most important part of the notes such as the possible test questions
i will try my best to do everything
in china professors taught student the things they believe students must learn
the slides works as a teaching assistance but they are still quiet clear
it can mobilize the eyes ears brains and hands to promote the understanding of the content of the lectures while avoiding the lack of concentration and the troubles of being trapped
look for a particular image formed by the final shape of the notes or aim to develop a particular image
foster success i have known a man who is really selfdiscipline he is good at time managing and he act strictly by his timetable
and he can always come up some interesting ideas for our group work to help us understand the lectures clearly and deeply
it gives me another way of thinking about my own self
arguing is not horrible the horrible thing is the arguing problems can not be solved
first of all in terms of academic issues i have experienced four years of undergraduate education in china and have some basic professional knowledge
however there are many obstacles such as i do not have a good studying habit and i am a procrastinator in fact
although there are a lot of articles in the library the manuals are the public version reviewed by the national education institution and teachers classes are all centred on the textbooks
this is also my strict requirements for myself in the future
they basically use ppt to display the content of each lecture
however in master degree each person decide to live whatever he wants to live ensuite or studio on campus or off campus
i take notes in almost every lecture
the teacher of international business will give an outline for each lesson and then expand the teaching content according to this outlinedr bidyut baruahs class will use ppt first to introduce a concept then explain the concept and then do some expansion from shallow to deep
when i was studying in the southampton for undergraduate course for construction management there were only 20 students and we normally learned in the small or medium classrooms
the second one is being selfcentered in the collaboration and ignoring the opinions of others
b is older than us and he has many working experiences
the plans are always very perfect and ideal but in fact there are many incidents that happen when i am working to the aim
york university sends email to inform usimportant things and leisure activities and i enjoy the feeling of being caredbecause i could not accept the email frequently like york university i feelthat i am left out7
however learning is a challenging process
i can feel the eye contact when the lecturer delivering in the class
since this term begin i have made a clear time table for every assignment
i first wondered why the sessions are not called lectures but as the time progressed here i realized that they have a reason behind it maybe in my sense
time management will foster successfor example shaofan wang always get up at 630 amand go to the gymthen take a showerand attend the classes in timei think people who can do good time management and selfcontrol goodly will foster success
the learning atmosphere of the members in the group made me excited
it is always important to be confident and felling relaxed about raising your voice and expressing your opinion
so i am really learning how to survive on my own here2
my favorite part is about group cooperation
another difference is that of the content itself my bsc was in physics and although there are many links especially in the maths behind certain phenomena i enjoy the application of audio and music a lot more
i learned innovative thinking and helping each other from my group work
i think they had do enough preparation before the lecture that is why they do not need take the notes
listening2
more discussion and more meetings may be a more effective way of existingteacherin china the probability that the teacher may see the teacher after class is relatively small but the teachers answer to the question is also mostly in class with low timeliness
the prerequisite for completing homework is to read a lot of materials
to be honest i have no expectations for the students in my class
we havent actually completed much work in groups but i suppose in the lab sessions we have had have involved helping each other out
frankly speaking there were more social events than i expected which surprised me
in fact i also have some disadvantages that may hinder my distinction in the way of distinctionbecause there are so many students who want to be excellent if i want to surpass them to get distonction i must be better than themhowever to some extent i am more lazy than lazy which is the biggest disadvantage for me because laziness may lead to my academic performance not as good as other students
what i have done so far satisfies the requirements of rae ethical principles strictly
however my biggest learning obstacle here is the language barrier
is an important part of the life
i should try to be more openminded to participate in the class
my expectation of the level of interaction is that the teacher can replay the email in time
by due time course we will build as great team to achieve our study goals
as is known to all it is meaningless
when the lecture is lecturing on the stage we can see clear slides we can hear their voices clearly and we can feel their charm
i am very expect the whole programme but i think the language would be a task to me
actually there are different types of the students who have different attitudes towards study
they can offer a worm and conformable study environment7
because the distinction grade does not only show the achievement of my effort in a period of time which can encourage me to continue working hard but also help me to find a good job in the future
i just want to try my best and listen to my destiny
but i think i will learn it well because john is a really interesting tutor who make me feel interesting in the lecture
i have a good time in york
complete and get the big marker out to cross them off the list
again while this might be ok in small doses if it becomes a habit i will have a problem
every lecturer was willing to answer the question asked by students although they hardly answered questions
how can i do
full of confidence
in york i train myself to study independently
they try to give as much information as possible
as i studied at york for my undergraduate degree i can not comment on a change in teaching styles however i can say that i have found the teaching on the msc has suited my learning style well
i like his way of teaching
taking the lecture of international business as an example john began to teach from the cultures of countries around the world
i feel happy with our induction programme
she presents clearly about his lecture
independent study unlike undergraduate course the amount of independent study is massive
i felta little tired and hungry
more selfarranged time
during my work timesi always didnt get accuracy drawingbecause lots of reasonsfor examplethe pipeline of air in locomotives do need to have accuracy size markingthe workers just bend the pipes and connect all the equipment well according to the really conditions of every locomotivehoweverit is better for longterm operation and maintenance to make same location of pipes in same sizeand improve the drawings to be accuratein true workshopthe workers don not want to change their habits of bending pipesthe designers have no time to track the accurate size and to update the drawingsin this situationit is difficult to follow the 3rd principle accuracy and rigour of the rae ethical principles
i think communication is one of the most crucial factors for successful collaborative learning
we have a lot of interactions between students and tutors
so i think it is better to let students do that in the class maybe they will do it seriously in this way
because the lecturers always use slides which are uploaded to the vle
secondly the educational system is different
with ppt you can know what part of the tutor is talking about so it is not too difficult to keep up with their ideasit is also very clear in logic
and she will do more interaction to engage us into this course such as some games
and their speeches were very fluent
yes i think my program will be very interesting
step up to the plate and knock this out
i need to do more reading in uk8
i could learn and grow in my field and be counted on when the going gets tough
in addition teaching style is different with what i experienced in the past like i need to work hard on team work
sometimes we focus on details that are notvery relevant to our assignment requirements
if it is not a specialized exercise class the teacher is more inclined to ask questions privately9
i have to say i am totally adapted to this after the language program
besides the teachers would like to ask some questiones and let us to answer them they will not criticize us even though the answer they disagree with
i didnt find any of the induction programme particularly surprising
for example when i have spare time or i am off class i may lie in my bed and play my smart phone rather than read books
maybe these behavious will hinder success
google translate is a good application but it is a bad habitto use it often
i compel myself only to take a rest no more than 20 minutes after dinner so when it start alarming i would stop watching videos and doing irrelevant issues and get back to the business start learning and finishing my homework
in addition they explain the question clearly
some of the teammates always do the minimum task and rely on the others
positive attitude is a important factor for successful
your team members need to be able to express themselves clearly to each other and successfully manage channels of communicationcompromisefor any team to work together in harmony and collectively solve problems all members of the team need to have the skill of compromise
but still i find them fun to learn new things and to get experience out of itas every student wishes i also aspire to be a distinction grade student and i hope to end up to be one
the first one is innovative thinking it is one of the skill which i missed after my work
i can say that i have done a good job so far did not affect the teams achievements and made my due contribution
because i can intuitively know the direction and general content of my future year
and here uk people have balance life work and life not like asian only study or work
if we want to understand this course we should learn culture first
i really like dr bidyut baruahs marketing of technology class
the way i treat these problems is that i will do research first
i think that it is a combination of knowledge in many fields including laws business math and communication
that is important i think
the level of interaction did not meet my expectation
therefore it is a absolute positive atmosphere
the first two month met many people experienced some things i start to feel the meaning of growth and life
but in york in addition to what the teacher said in class i still need to have my own ideas6
under this circumstance tolerance can be the best way to solve this problem
no matter in daily communication or in class the teacher speaks english
and rationally think about the rational allocation of this homework try to let the team members finish the teams homework as soon as possibleat the same time i will organize more team members to carry out some activities to enhance tacit understanding and mutual understanding so as to avoid many cooperation problemsin addition i also hope that we can meet some technical challenges so that our team can work together to overcome these technical problems
every task has a deadline so doing so can be dangerous
many factors
when i see people from other country i only observe them and i am not judge them nownow i ask myself these course i need to learn very well in order to deal very well in the future internationational projectsnow i have changed the ways see the world
after listening to these five weeks i can almost hear the content of the speech clearly and all the presentations about the slides are also very clear
i think engineering management is an applied science we need some experience to help me understand my courses better
similarly using mobile phone is also not a good habit in the lecture
the second point is the difficulty of the exam
no one lead the team and dont have a clearly goal3
this will helpimprove the effectiveness of collaborative learning
im little surprised about it cause sit in the middle have a better vision
before i never worked in a group for so many times like this semester
i think there have some part that to become a distinction grade studentshowever there still have many deficiencies that i need to be improved andstudied so farfirstly i think as a qualified studentfrom master degreed need to foucus on what we want
i had lots of clubs and activities in my last university but now i feel assignment heavy and i am afriad that i can achive distinction10
the lecturer for my ios programming for music technology is especially enthusiastic and his lectures are usually very funny and enjoyable to attend
i think i am a pragmatic person so maybe i can correct the error when our group goes wrong
tony ward i could not hear very well because as i said before theclasses was very big
and he always put some interesting images on his slides to explain some abstract concepts
i think it is really a good habit and it did help me a lot in my study as well as work these years
i think they all great
i can clearly hear the voice of every lecturerthe slides of dr bidyut baruah are clear and clear
and if i have some questions they are able to answer them
no i did not be in or take actions to contrary to the rae ethical principles
most of them pay attention to listen to the courses and will take relative notes on keywords the rest of them do listen but keep their smartphones screen on and play with video games at the same time
if every student in a class is very serious about learning it is bound to be an environment that may cause students who do not want to learn to start learning
chinese university teachers will manage students afterschool life

he could always have new idea in each project
